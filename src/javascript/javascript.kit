  <!-- Description -->
  <p class="uk-text-justify">
    The most popular programming language on the web. I learned JS in a 
    web programming class during the first year of my degree. I can't 
    think of a single project I have made that doesn't make use of the 
    langauge in one way or another. The projects below are mainly just 
    simple web applications, but with some notable JS scripting built 
    into them.
