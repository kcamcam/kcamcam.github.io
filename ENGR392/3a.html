They &quot;burned&quot; their nuclear fuel and left behind </span><span class="c0">nuclear</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&quot;ash&quot; Technically, of course, none of these terms made sense, since burning is a chemical process and a reactor gets its energy from fission, but journalists liked the terminology because it was easy and quick. One loaded fuel into the reactor, flipped a switch, and things got very hot. If that wasn&#39;t exactly a furnace, it was close enough.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c0">And actually, the metaphor was pretty good-up to a point. The basement furnace burns one of several different fuels: natural gas or fuel oil or even, in some ancient models, coal. Nuclear reactors can be built to use plutonium, natural uranium, or uranium that has been enriched to varying degrees. Home furnaces have a &quot;coolant&quot;-the air that is circulated through I the furnace and out through the rest of the house, carrying heat away from is the fire. Reactors have a coolant, too-the liquid or gas that carries heat away from the reactor core to another part of the plant, where heat energy is transformed into electrical energy. There, however, the </span><span class="c0">metaphor sputters</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;out. In a nuclear reactor, the coolant not only transfers heat to a steam generator or a turbine, but it also keeps the fuel from overheating. The coolant in a furnace does nothing of the sort. And most reactors use a moderator to Speed up the fission reaction. The basement burner has nothing similar. But the most importance weakness of the furnace metaphor is that it obscured just how many varieties of reactors were possible-and, consequently, obscured the difficult choice facing the early nuclear industry: Which reactor type should become the basis for commercial nuclear power? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">The possibilities were practically unlimited. The fuel selection was wide. The coolant could be nearly anything that has good heat-transfer </span><span class="c0">properties</span><span class="c2 c0">: air, carbon dioxide, helium, water, liquid metals, organic liquids, and so on. And the options for the moderator were equally broad: carbon, light water, heavy water, beryllium and other metals, organic liquids, and even, in some reactors, no moderator at all. With all these choices, selecting a reactor type became like ordering Chinese food from a fixed-price menu: take one item from column A, one from column B, one from column C. Some combinations might work better than others, and some might not work at all, but the number of combinations was huge.</span></p><p class="c3 c19"><span class="c2 c0">Although few laymen realized just how many options existed, the members of the nuclear community did. Even before the end of World War II, workers in the Manhattan Project had dreamed up a variety of reactors they thought would be feasible. By 1955, at the Peaceful Uses of the Atom Conference held in Geneva, Alvin Weinberg reported that several hundred types of reactors were conceivable; of these, many were obviously impracti. cal, but a hundred or so might actually do the job.</span></p><p class="c3 c21"><span class="c2 c0">Which would be best for generating electricity? No one knew. Each reactor type was likely to have its own characteristic set of advantages and disadvantages. Without designing, building, and operating the reactors, choosing among them would be nothing more than educated guesswork. Yet it would cost far too much to develop a number of competing lines independently and see which was most effective as a mature technology. How, then, should the choice be made?</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">Many new technologies face a similar predicament. When personal computers first came onto the market beginning in the 1970s, a large number of companies offered mostly incompatible machines: MITS, IMSAI, Cromemco, Apple, Processor Technology, Tandy, Osborne, IBM, and many many others over the first decade of the personal computer industry. When videocassette recorders were initially offered to consumers, people had to choose between Betamax and VHS formats. More recently, crystalline-silicon and amorphous-silicon technologies have been dueling over the market for solar cells. In each case, two or more versions of a technology have competed for adoption as each is evolving and improving.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">How do we-and how should we-make choices between such competing technologies? Traditionally, economists have paid relatively little attention to this question, simply assuming that the market will do the right thing. According to classical economic theory, when a choice exists among various alternatives, the market will take the one that offers the most efficient use and allocation of resources-i.e., the one that gives the biggest bang for the buck. This is a nice, comforting notion: As long as the various technologies are competing in a free and open market, we can expect to arrive at the best of all possible outcomes,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Unfortunately, it ain&#39;t so. To make a rational decision, anyone-even a vague, sweeping entity like the &quot;market&quot;-needs information, and for</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">nasc</span><span class="c2 c0">ent technologies, information is in short supply. How difficult and expensive will it be to perfect this version or that? What problems will </span><span class="c0">appear</span><span class="c2 c0">? Will any of them prove to be show stoppers? What is the long-term potential of each of the options? Early in the development process, no one knows the answers to any of these questions. People can make forecasts and predictions, of course, basing them on experience from earlier </span><span class="c0">development</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;efforts, but the future seldom behaves as expected. And when the technology is complex, the forecasters might as well be reading tea leaves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; I</span><span class="c2 c0">n the face of this uncertainty, decisions about a technology hinge on </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;sorts of montechnica factors we&#39;ve already encountered. The gut feelings of engineers. Political forces. Business considerations. The historical coincidences that put this person in that place at just the right time to have a deciding influence on the path a technology takes. For all practical purposes, most of these factors can be considered to be random, since they are </span><span class="c0">impossible</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to predict. The development of a technology proceeds not as a well planned-out campaign (although parts of it clearly are well thought out) but rather as a disjointed effort that only in hindsight seems to have been moving toward a particular conclusion.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">Nonetheless, economists and others have traditionally assumed that in some vague way this haphazard process does-with the help of the marketzero in on the best choice. The collective result of millions of individual decisions, each of which might be only partially rational or even completely irrational, will itself be rational. As in Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution, natural selection will ultimately result in the survival of the fittest. And certainly it often works out this way. The long competition between AC and DC described in the first chapter did end with the better technology taking over the market, though it was more difficult than it should have been.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">But the best technology doesn&#39;t always win. Early decisions, made with relatively little information, can strongly affect the evolution of a technology. lf, for instance, one approach attracts more investment early on, that could speed its development and allow it to open up a lead over its rivals, giving it an advantage in attracting even more investment. Or an early lead in sales when the market is small can snowball into a dominant position later on, even if the product is not obviously superior. Such influences make technological choice path dependent-the ultimate outcome can depend on a myriad of small, seemingly insignificant factors. Economists have disCovered-to their surprise-that far from being completely rational, markets can sometimes settle on a technology that is clearly inferior to other choices. Indeed, even if the individual participants in a market all behave in a completely rational way, making their decisions logically according to the best available information, a weaker technology may get &quot;locked in,&quot; shutting out other, potentially better choices from the market,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Consider, for example, the automobile. Although the internal-combustion engine has been the king of the road for more than half a century, some stili wonder if we didn&rsquo;t take a wrong turn near the beginning.</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.ibrayztb83zm"><span>STEAM VERSUS INTERNAL COMBUSTION</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">At the turn of the century, when horseless carriages were first becoming common in Europe and the United States, three different types were running neck and neck in popularity: electric, steam, and gasoline. The electric cars were particularly appealing because of their clean, quiet operation and smooth starting and acceleration. And they were fast-at the time, they held the world&#39;s land speed record. But they had what proved to be a crucial technical flaw: the batteries that powered them were heavy and had to be recharged frequently, making the cars unsuitable for sustained use. (Indeed, it is only now, a century later, that decades of hard work in battery technology are starting to make the electric car practical.) This left two technologies-steam power and internal combustion-competing to propel the coming automotive revolution, and although we know the outcome now, at the time it looked like a horse race.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">The great advantage of internal combustion was that it enabled a lot of power to be generated by a relatively small, lightweight engine. Its great disadvantage was that it wasn&#39;t well suited to operate at the speeds most convenient for an automobile. The standard four-stroke internal combustion engine, invented by Nikolaus Otto in 1876, goes through a cycle of four steps, only one of which provides power: a fuel-air mixture is drawn into a cylinder; a piston compresses this mixture; the mixture is ignited, pushing the piston out and generating power; and the exhaust gases are pushed out of the cylinder, emptying it for the next cycle. This is inherently a very jerky, uneven process, so the piston was attached to a large flywheel which smoothed the in-and-out movement of the piston. But the presence of th flywheel limited the engine&#39;s range of speeds; the larger the flywheel, the smoother the operation but the narrower the limits. And the mechanics </span><span class="c0">of</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the gasoline engine imposed another set of limits. Since each cycle in gasoline engine produces only a small amount of power, the engine must be run at several thousand cycles per minute to be most efficient. On the other hand, the engines would stall if slowed much below a thousand revolutions per minute. The result of all these limits was that the internal combustion engine had an effective operating range of perhaps eight or nine hundred revolutions per minute up to several thousand.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">This range matched up poorly with the demands of the automobile, whose wheels needed to turn at anywhere from a few dozen revolutions per minute to a thousand or more at high speeds. To build a gasoline-powered car, inventors thus had to develop a transmission system that could gear down from several thousand revolutions per minute to three hundred, or si</span><span class="c0">x hundred, or nine hundred, depending on the speed a driver wanted to g. It was a difficult, complicated task, and although engineers did eventually manage to develop effective transmission systems, they remain a trouble spot for automobiles even today - a reminder that the internal combustion engine is not well suited, at least in this one respect, to th the task of powering an automobile. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; The steam engine had its own set of pluses and minuses. Like electric cars, steam-powered vehicles could be much smoother and quieter than their gas-powered counterparts. And they had plenty of power - in 1906, a Stanley Steamer set a land speed record of more than 127 mph. Because the engine turned at hundreds of revolutions per minute instead of thousands, there was no need for a transmission, and wear and tear on the internal parts was much less. A more mature technology than internal combustion, steam engines posed fewer engineering problems to solve before they could operate smoothly and dependably. And they were much simpler-the engine in one later Stanley model had only twenty-two moving parts, no more than were contained in the self-starter alone on gas-powered car. Finally steam-powered cars were much easier to drive. Not only did the operator of a gas-powered automobile have to worry about working the clutch and shifting gears simultaneously, but starting the car was a major production</span><span class="c2 c0">. A driver or brave assistant had to prime the cylinder, advance the &nbsp;spark, and then turn the crank, being careful to let go quickly. The crank could spin around and break an arm if one wasn&#39;t careful. As one automotive author wrote in 1904, &quot;Every steam carriage which passes along the street justifies the confidence placed in it; and unless the objectionable features of the petrol carriage can be removed, it is bound to be driven from the road, to give place to its less objectionable rival, the steam-driven vehicle of the day.&quot; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c0">The steamer&#39;s weaknesses sprang not from its engine but from its burner, in which a variable fire was kept burning, and from its boiler, in which water was turned into steam to push a piston and power the engine. Until</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">automatic controls were perfected in the 1920s, the boiler demanded a great deal of attention from the driver. Furthermore, early models weren&#39;t equipped with condensers to capture and reuse the water, so the boilers needed to be refilled periodically. The signature of the old steamers was a cloud of water vapor trailing the car</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c2 c0">Taking everything into account, the steamers and gas-powered cars seemed evenly matched. Both offered advantages and disadvantages to their operators, and each had attributes that advocates could point to as evidence of natural superiority-compactness for the internal combustion engine, and simplicity for the steam engine. Even after thirty years of development, it still wasn&#39;t clear which was the superior choice. The gas-powered Car was already taking a commanding lead in the market, but as Harvard</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">historian Charles McLaughlin writes, &quot;The Doble steam car, built in the late 1920s and early 1930s, was unsurpassed in trouble-free operation and performance by any car at that time.&rdquo; That Doble automobile, however, was steam&#39;s last hurrah-one final, failing attempt to bring the steam engine to an industry that had already decided internal combustion was the way to go.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c0">If the two technologies were so well matched, why did gas-powered cars come to monopolize the market? The classical economic explanation would be that it was a rational market decision, that in the final analysis internal combustion must have been the superior technical choice. But many people who know more about automobiles than economics have challenged that. What really happened, they say, was that much more development went into the internal combustion engine than into its steam counterpart. S.O. White, an engineer who worked on automatic transmissions in the 1940s, put it this way:</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c2 c7">if the money and effort that have been put into the gasoline engine had been concentrated on the steam engine, its boiler and controls, we would not now be discussing automatic transmissions. The gasoline engine is so firmly entrenched that we must have some kind of </span><span class="c7">multi speed</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;transmission to </span><span class="c7">makeup</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;for its deficiencies. We can only use the steam car performance as an ideal we would like to attain.</span></p><p class="c3 c16"><span class="c2 c0">Even now, engineers calculate optimal efficiencies for steam- and gas-p</span><span class="c0">ow</span><span class="c2 c0">ered cars and wonder if steam might have proved to be a better option.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c0">The reality is that the automotive competition between internal comb</span><span class="c0">us</span><span class="c2 c0">tion and steam power was not decided according to which was the better technology. Instead, the victory of internal combustion was the result o</span><span class="c0">f a </span><span class="c2 c0">confluence of factors that were mostly independent of the technical issues.</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c0">One factor was that the developers of the gas-powered car, people like</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Ransom Olds and Henry Ford, were not just good engineers but also </span><span class="c0">savvy</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;businessmen, Many of the early producers of the gasoline cars </span><span class="c0">set up</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;s</span><span class="c0">hop</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in and around Detroit, and there they developed an entirely new way </span><span class="c0">of</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;doing business, mass-producing one or a few models and then selling them at low prices through large distribution networks</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c0">By contrast, the Stanley Company-the leader and longest-lived of the steam-powered car manufacturers-was a relic of an earlier time of </span><span class="c0">careful</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;craftsmanship and local markets. The Stanley twins were inventors </span><span class="c0">who were</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;much more interested in designing and building excellent cars than in selling them by the millions. Their Massachusetts factory employed skilled workmen who could customize a car, even changing the wheel base &nbsp;according to the request of the buyer, and who might attach the boilers diff</span><span class="c0">iculty</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;depending on who was doing the assembly. This not only made the car</span><span class="c0">s</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;much more expensive to build than, say, Ford&#39;s Model T (which was ava</span><span class="c0">ila</span><span class="c2 c0">ble in any color you wanted, so long as it was black), but it</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;made them m</span><span class="c0">ore difficult to </span><span class="c2 c0">service. That didn&#39;t bother the Stanleys, however. They were content to </span><span class="c0">s</span><span class="c2 c0">ell a relatively small nu</span><span class="c0">m</span><span class="c2 c0">ber of cars to aficionados who were willing to pay a premium price. Before the start of World War I, the Stanley Company&#39;s entire yearly production-about 650 cars&mdash;was about what </span><span class="c0">Henry For</span><span class="c2 c0">d turned out in one day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; This approach </span><span class="c2 c0">worked for more than a decade, but it couldn&#39;t last. The </span><span class="c0">Stanley Company</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;was a relatively small business with little capital reserve, and a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;series of</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;setbacks combined to sink it. Because the Stanleys tried to keep the</span><span class="c0">ir cars </span><span class="c2 c0">as simple as possible, they had never installed condensers to recycle the water. This was not a major problem at first, since most of their</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cars were operated in New England, where everything was close together and people seldom drove long distances, and, besides there were plenty of horse trough along the sides of the roads where the cars could take on more water. But in 1914 an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease broke out, and most of the public horse troughs were removed to prevent its spread. Suddenly the Stanley brothers were forced to developed a condensing system for their engined, and they cut back production drastically until they had finished it. </span><span class="c2 c0">By 1916 they had come up with a condenser and started to revive pro</span><span class="c0">duction,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;but they were blindsided once again. In 1917, the United States entered World War I, and the government restricted consumer </span><span class="c0">manufacturing</span><span class="c2 c0">. By law, a company could produce only half of its average annual output over the previous three years, which left the Stanley company able to manufacture only a very few cars. After the war, the weakened company seemed about to get back on its feet when hit by a third stroke of bad luck: The 1 920 recession. It drove prices down and left the company-which had bought its inventory of parts at high prices just before the recession hit - u</span><span class="c0">nable</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">to make a profit. It never recovered. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; O</span><span class="c2 c0">ther firms making steam-powered cars either went out of business or</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">s</span><span class="c0">w</span><span class="c2 c0">itched to the internal combustion engine, but McLaughlin </span><span class="c0">concludes</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;that the gasoline car&#39;s takeover of the market was not due to any technological Superiority: &ldquo;The principal factor responsible for the demise of the Steam car was neither technical drawbacks nor a conspiracy of hostile interests, but rather the fact that its fate was left in the hands of small manufacturers. Even White and Stanley, the most prominent makers, failed to introduce the innovations in production and selling which would have enabled them to survive in the face of Detroit competition.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">POSITIVE FEED</span><span class="c4">B</span><span class="c2 c4">AC</span><span class="c4">K</span><span class="c2 c4">S, </span><span class="c4">QW</span><span class="c2 c4">ERTY</span><span class="c4">, AND </span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;TECHNOLOGIC</span><span class="c4">AL LOCK-IN</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">It&#39;s not important to us whether the steam automobile was potentially</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">supeFlor to the gas-powered car-some automotive engineers argue that it was,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">but no one really knows. What is important is that the fate of the automobile was not foreordained. It depended on a sequence of actions and events that, had they been different, could easily have yielded another outcome. If, for instance, the backers of the steam-powered car had congregated in Detroit and developed a product that could be mass-produced and mass marketed, while the proponents of the internal-combustion engine had been content to make expensive cars for a small market, perhaps we&#39;d all be driving steamers today.</span></p><p class="c3 c21"><span class="c2 c0">This is the same path dependence we encountered in chapter 1. There&#39;s nothing particularly surprising about the idea that different paths should lead to different outcomes-unless you&#39;ve taken a few economics courses. Classical economics describes a World determined by the balancing of war. ious forces-supply versus demand, cost versus benefit, and so on. In this view, the fate of a new technology is settled by such things as its cost, how well it does its job, how well it meets a demand, and how it compares with other t</span><span class="c2 c0">echnologies that do the same or similar jobs. There is no place in the equations of classical economics for an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth. disease.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c0">In recent years, however, a new breed of economist/historian has begun studying the question of how technologies evolve, and these researchers find that it&#39;s not possible to understand the introduction of a new techno</span><span class="c0">l</span><span class="c2 c0">ogy without looking closely at its history. Technological innovation depends upon a complex and subtle interplay of forces: the timing, content, and dissemination of scientific discoveries; the existing technological infrastru</span><span class="c0">c</span><span class="c2 c0">ture; market judgments about the potential of and demand for a new te</span><span class="c0">ch</span><span class="c2 c0">nology; decisions made by organizations, whether in business or gove</span><span class="c0">rn</span><span class="c2 c0">ment; and the actions of a few key individuals, such as inventors, influential industrialists, and powerful government officials.</span></p><p class="c3 c19"><span class="c0 c2">This new approach to understanding technological development differs from that of classical economics in a number of ways, but the most i</span><span class="c0">mport</span><span class="c2 c0">ant is probably its emphasis on increasing returns, or &quot;positive feedback Conventional economics concentrates on situations in which diminishing returns push the market to an equilibrium. When oil prices skyrocketed in the 1970s, people began conserving energy by buying smaller cars, drivi</span><span class="c0">ng</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;less, and lowering their thermostats, thus decreasing the demand for o</span><span class="c0">l </span><span class="c2 c0">and pushing its price back down. Or in 1994, when Congress voted a ban on &quot;assault weapons,&quot; people rushed to gun stores to buy them before the law went into effect; this increased demand created a sharp increase in prices for the guns, pushing the demand back down, since fewer custo</span><span class="c0">mers were</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;willing to pay the inflated charges. This is standard freshman economics: when something pushes on the market, the market pushes back, reestablishing a balance. In the language of the physical sciences, which </span><span class="c0">economists have a</span><span class="c2 c0">dopted, this push is called &quot;negative feedback.&quot; It acts the same way in a market that it does in a machine or electronic device, nudging everyt</span><span class="c0">hing towards an equilibrium - an equilibrium that, according to classical economics, marks the most efficient use of a resource.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c0">In modern </span><span class="c2 c0">ern economies, however, there are many situations in which </span><span class="c0">increasing r</span><span class="c2 c0">eturns, not diminishing returns, hold sway. One of the most familiar examples is the Betamax-versus-VHS competition for the </span><span class="c0">videocassette</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;recorder market. When the two forma</span><span class="c0">ts come on the market, consumers had to choose one or the other, since a Beta video recorder would not play VHS tapes and vice versa. Many experts thought the Beta format was technically superior to VHS, but the advantage was not so large that other factors could not cancel it out - which indeed is what happened. At first, the two formats had roughly equal market shares, but then VHS got a small advantage, thanks to perhaps its marketing campaign, or some quirk of customer psychology, or just plain luck. </span><span class="c2 c0">With more VHS customers, the stores that rented and sold videotape movies made more titles</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;available on VHS. This in turn led still more people to choose VHS, which guaranteed more VHS titles in the stores, and so on in a self-reinforcing cycle, until VHS became the de facto standard for the industry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; B</span><span class="c2 c0">rian Arthur, an economist at Stanford and the Santa Fe Institute who has studied the effects of such positive feedbacks, notes that they create uncertainty in the market. Because small, random events that happen early can be magnified to have great importance later, the eventual outcome can depend quite sensitively on circumstances-it is path dependent. A chance laboratory discovery may push a developing technology in an entirely different direction than it would have taken otherwise. The unwillingness of venture capitalists to provide funds to a struggling company aborts what could have been a major new market a decade later. A computer language developed for early computers, which had relatively little power or memory, becomes a standard that shapes the programs written for much more powerfu</span><span class="c0">l</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;computers a decade later. In particular, Arthur notes, such path dependence implies that the outcome cannot be predicted with any certainty ahead of time. When VCRs were first offered for sale, no one knew which format would predominate.</span></p><p class="c3 c17"><span class="c2 c0">Negative and positive feedbacks create markets with very different properties. The usual way of visualizing a classical, negative-feedback market is to think of a marble inside a bowl. The force of gravity pulls the marble down toward the bottom of the bowl, which is its equilibrium point. No matter where the marble starts out or what path it takes, its eventual position is easy to predict. Positive feedback turns this picture upside down-literally. Think of the marble as balanced on the top of an inverted bowl. If jostled, it no longer moves back to where it was, but rather takes off down the side of the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">bowl with increasing speed. And there&#39;s no way to predict just where the marble will end up, since the destination will depend sensitively on the precise details of the jostle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Conventional economics has focused on negative feedbacks and equilibria, Arthur says, because until recently those have been the most important factors in understanding the economy. In any market based on </span><span class="c0">resources farming</span><span class="c2 c0">, mining, the production of bulk goods-diminishing returns hold sway because resources are limited. If beef, for example, were to experience a sudden surge in popularity, that popularity would not build on itself until beef began to crowd out chicken, pork, and lamb in the meat market. Instead, the greater demand would lead to greater production, which would push up the prices of cattle feed and ranch land, making beef more expensive and stabilizing the yen for beef, perhaps at a somewhat higher level than before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">In many modern markets, however, information is more important than physical resources, and, Arthur says, when information is involved, increasing returns are likely to take a hand. Consider the personal computer. It is an extremely complicated machine, and designing and building just one demands an investment of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development. Building the second one, however, is relative cheap-the only cost is for the parts and labor to assemble it. Building </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;thousandth or the millionth one is even cheaper, thanks to learning effects in manufacturing and economies of scale, and the benefits to an individ customer of the millionth personal computer are likely to be much higher than those of the first or second. With a million computers on the market there will be much more software available, with the costs of individual programs shared among many users, and people can share their experiences to help each other get more out of their computers. In general, Arth says, when the major investment in a product is the knowledge needed to make it-whether it&#39;s a computer, a drug, or an advanced material such as high strength ceramic-then the price per unit drops and the profit increas</span><span class="c0">es</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;with greater production and sales. Unlike beef, sales of such knowledge based products feed on themselves, with each success making it </span><span class="c0">more likely</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;that the successes will keep coming. </span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c2 c0">Arthur points to five separate ways that technologies can become more attractive as they become more widely adopted, First, the more of a product that a manufacturer makes and sells, the more it can improve the product by learning from both its own experience and that of its custo</span><span class="c0">mers. This </span><span class="c2 c0">learning-by-doing and learning-by-using is, as we saw in the last chapter particularly important in complex technologies. Second, </span><span class="c0">c</span><span class="c2 c0">onsumers often find that it pays to belong to a large community of users of a particular product. This was why VHS won the battle of the VCR formats. Third, if economies of scale </span><span class="c0">exist in</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;making a product-which is often</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the case when research </span><span class="c2 c0">and development are a major part of the cost of the product-the price will come down with increased production. Fourth, many people will decide which product to buy based on how widespread it already is, figuring that </span><span class="c0">lesser</span><span class="c2 c0">-used technologies are less well tested and thus riskier. And fifth, many </span><span class="c0">tech</span><span class="c2 c0">nologies demand an infrastructure, which grows and becomes mor</span><span class="c0">e e</span><span class="c2 c0">ntrenched as the technology is adopted. The automobile, for </span><span class="c0">instance, </span><span class="c2 c0">relies on a network of oil refineries and gas stations, parts manufacture</span><span class="c0">rs </span><span class="c2 c0">and stores, repair shops, and so on. A competing technology wit</span><span class="c0">hout such a </span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;well-established infrastructure would be at a huge disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c0">M</span><span class="c2 c0">odern, complex technologies like the automobile and the computer oft</span><span class="c0">e</span><span class="c2 c0">n fall into several of those categories, making them particularly likely to have increasing, rather than diminishing, returns. But modern technologies</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are by</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;no means the only examples. One of the best-studied cases took place more than a cent</span><span class="c0">ury ago with a relatively low-tech product: the typewriter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; T</span><span class="c2 c0">oday, almost all typewriters and computer keyboards have the same key placement: the so-called QWERTY layout, named for the first six letters on the top line of letters on the keyboard. QWERTY is not a particularly efficient layout.-a typist&#39;s fingers must move from their &quot;home&rdquo; position to hit many of the most common letters-and periodically people have tried to </span><span class="c0">re</span><span class="c2 c0">place it with something better. The best-known alternative is the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard system, developed in 1932, which allows typists to type faster than with QWERTY-somewhere between 5 percent and 40 percent faster, depending on whose claims you believe. But QWERTY has had a lock on the market for a hundred years, thanks to historical accident coupled with increasing returns.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c0">Christopher Latham Sholes, a printer from Milwaukee, was the inventor of one early version of the typewriter. He filed for a patent in 1867, but the machine was plagued by a </span><span class="c0">number</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;of faults, the most serious of which was the tendency of its typebars (the bars that fly up to strike the ribbon and print a letter on the paper) to hit each other and jam together if the typist struck the keys too quickly in succession. Instead of improving the typeWriter design to avoid this problem, Sholes experimented with various keyboard layouts, looking for one that would keep the typist from picking up too much speed and thus minimize jams. In 1873, when he had something that worked reasonably well, Sholes and a partner sold the manufacturing tights to the arms maker, E. Remington and Sons. Remington in turn made a few minor changes to produce the QWERTY keyboard in essentially the Same layout that exists today. One of Remington&#39;s modifications, for example, was to move the &quot;R&quot; up to the second row, replacing the period, so that Salesmen could impress customers by typing out </span><span class="c0">TYPEWRITER</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;(the brand name) without their fingers leaving the row.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c0">At the same time that Remington was offering its QWERTY typewriter,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">other Companies were offering their own machines, each with its own key. board layout. Some of the models avoided the problem with the typebars that plagued the Sholes design, which allowed them to place the keys in more Convenient locations. One arrangement, the &quot;Ideal&quot; keyboard, put all the most common letters in the home row (DHIATENSOR), so that a typist could form 70 percent of English words without the fingers leaving that row.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">It took more than a decade before the typewriter began to catch on, but it booned in the 1880s, and soon touch typing became a valuable office skill. Once this happened, the selection of a keyboard layout was subject to a powerful positive feedback. Workers, if they were going to put in the time to learn to type, wanted to train in the system that was most widespread, This way they could more easily find jobs and would be less likely to have to learn a second system. Employers, in turn, had an incentive to buy typewriters with the most popular keyboard layout-it would be easier to find typists. who already knew how to use that layout and so avoid having to pay to train them. With both workers and employers looking to use the most popular layout, positive feedback guaranteed strongly increasing returns. Whichever choice gained an initial lead would be likely to expand it, eventually putting its competitors out of business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">QWERTY may not have had the most sensible keyboard arrangement but it had the advantage that it had been out longer than most other designs. Throughout the 1880s, typewriters with a variety of keyboard layouts were sold, but in the 1890s the market moved more and more towards QWERTY, and by the first decade of the twentieth century it had taken over. The takeover was similar to what happened with office word-processing software in the late 1980s, as WordPerfect became a de facto standard in offices across the country.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">For almost a century now, nothing has overturned QWERTY&#39;s predo</span><span class="c0">m</span><span class="c2 c0">inance. In the 1940s the U.S. Navy experimented with the Dvorak syst</span><span class="c0">em and </span><span class="c2 c0">found that it speeded up typing. Indeed, a U.S. Navy report claimed that it accelerated typing speeds so much that an office that </span><span class="c0">trained</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;its </span><span class="c0">typists on</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;a Dvorak keyboard would recoup the cost of that training within ten days. Other tests have seen less of an improvement in typing speeds, and a conservative estimate is that typists using Dvorak will, on average, be about 5 percent faster. Either way, QWERTY remains the office standard, and although Dvorak proponents argue-quite correctly-that theirs is the superior system, the upstart can make no headway</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">A similar challenge faced the gas-powered automobile in the mid 1920s with similar results. After the collapse of the Stanley company </span><span class="c0">and other</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;makers of steam cars, the industrialist Abner Doble decided to g</span><span class="c0">ive it one</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;more try. He had become convinced that the steam car, if it incorp</span><span class="c0">orated all</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the advances that had been made in controlling its burner, would be su</span><span class="c0">perior to gasoline cars.</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;So he set out to build and sell steamers using all the tricks that had worked for the big Detroit auto manufacturers. He assembled a network of a thousand dealers, applied all the latest manufacturing techniques, and even set up production in Detroit to have easy access to skilled workers and all the little companies that had sprung up to provide p</span><span class="c0">arts</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and supplies for the big car makers. By all accounts, the Doble ste</span><span class="c2 c0">am </span><span class="c0">c</span><span class="c2 c0">ars were excellent products-as good as or better than anything powered by an internal-combustion engine-and the company started out with $20 million in advance orders. If anyone could have broken the monopoly of the gas-powered car, it should have been Doble. But he couldn&#39;t. The</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Doble-Detroit Company died during the Depression, and for sixty years</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;no</span><span class="c2 c0">thing has come close to replacing the internal combustion engine. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2 c0">Faced with this sort of intractability, it&#39;s tempting to think that something is interfering with the workings of the free market. Perhaps the mak</span><span class="c0">ers </span><span class="c2 c0">of the gasoline-powered cars colluded to sink Doble&rsquo;s company. Or perhaps, as August Dvorak once suggested, the typewriter makers conspired against his invention because they feared that speeding up typing too much would lower the demand for their products. But no. This &quot;technological lock-in,&quot; as </span><span class="c2 c0">Arthur named it, makes perfectly good sense if looked at from the perspective of increasing returns.</span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c2 c0">&quot;Once a technology has reached a certain level of adoption, anyone who chooses an alternative technology ends up paying a premium. In the case of the typewriter keyboard, an employer would have to retrain existing employees and would find it more difficult to hire new employees, who Would prefer not to have to learn a new system. Employees who moved from QWERTY would not only have to take the time to learn a new system but would also hurt their chances of getting a job at another company. A few employers and employees might judge the investment to be worth it, but not most. Each individual decision to stay with QWERTY is a rational one, but all those rational decisions add up to an irrational, or at least a </span><span class="c0">less than</span><span class="c2 c0">-optimal, choice.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c0">All in all, it&#39;s a rather unsatisfactory situation from a classical economist&#39;s point of view. When new technologies compete with each other in an increasing-returns market, the ultimate winner of the competition will often be determined by random events (&quot;random&quot; in the sense that they have nothing to do with the technical merits of the technology). Depending on the particular path the competition takes, an inferior technology may well Come out on top. And once this happens, that second-rate choice may become locked in. Positive feedbacks may have their advantages-such as dramatically lowering the costs of many modern technologies-but guaranteeing the best outcome isn&#39;t one of them,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
