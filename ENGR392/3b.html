Orbiting the earth aboard Friendship 7 in February 1962, astronaut John Glenn noticed something odd. His view </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;planet was virtually unique in human experience; only Soviet pilots Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov had preceded him in orbital flight. Yet as he watched the continents and oceans moving beneath him, Glenn began to feel that he had seen it all before. Months </span><span class="c0">of simulated</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;space shots in sophisticated training machines and </span><span class="c0">centrifuges</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;had affected his ability to respond. In the words </span><span class="c0">of chronicler</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Tom Wolfe, &quot;The world demanded awe, because this was a voyage through the stars. But he couldn&#39;t feel it. The backdrop of the event, the stage, the environment, the true orbit . . . was not the vast reaches </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;universe. It was the simulators. Who could possibly understand this?&quot;</span><span class="c2 c0">1</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Synthetic conditions generated in the training center had begun to seem more &quot;real&quot; than the actual experience.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;It is reasonable to suppose that a society thoroughly </span><span class="c0">committed</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to making artificial realities would have given a great deal of thought to the nature of that commitment. One might </span><span class="c0">expect</span><span class="c1 c0">, for example, that the philosophy </span><span class="c0">of technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;would be a topic widely discussed by scholars and technical professionals, a lively field of inquiry often chosen by students at our </span><span class="c0">universities</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and technical institutes. One might even think that the basic issues in this field would be well defined, its central </span><span class="c0">controversies</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;well worn. However, such is not the case. At this late date in the development </span><span class="c0">of our</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;industrial/technological </span><span class="c0">civilization</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the most accurate observation to be made about the </span><span class="c0">philosophy</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is that there really isn&#39;t one.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The basic task for a philosophy of technology is to examine critically the nature and significance of artificial aids to human activity. That is its appropriate domain </span><span class="c0">of inquiry</span><span class="c1 c0">, one that sets it apart from, say, the philosophy </span><span class="c0">of science</span><span class="c1 c0">. Yet </span><span class="c0">if one</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;turns to the writings of twentieth-century philosophers, one finds </span><span class="c0">astonishing</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;little attention given to questions of that kind. The six-volume Encyclopedia </span><span class="c0">of Philosophy</span><span class="c1 c0">, a recent compendium of major themes in various traditions of philosophical discourse, contains no entry under the category &quot;technology.&quot;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Neither does that work contain enough material under possible </span><span class="c0">alternative</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;headings to enable anyone to piece together an idea of what a philosophy of </span><span class="c0">te</span><span class="c1 c0">chnology might be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">True, there are some writers who have taken up the topic. The standard bibliography in the philosophy of technology lists well over a thousand books and articles in several languages by nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors. 3 But reading through the material listed shows, in my view, little of enduring substance. The best writing on this theme comes to us from a few powerful thinkers who have encountered the subject in the midst of much broader and ambitious investigations-for ex- ample, Karl Marx in the development </span><span class="c0">of his</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;theory of historical materialism or Martin Heidegger as an aspect of his theory of ontology. It may be, in fact, that the philosophy is best seen as a derivative of more fundamental questions. For despite the fact that nobody would deny its importance to an adequate </span><span class="c0">understanding</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of the human condition, technology has never joined epistemology, metaphysics, esthetics, law, science, and politics as a fully respectable topic for philosophical inquiry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Engineers have shown little interest in filling this void. </span><span class="c0">Except</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;for airy pronouncements in yearly presidential addresses at various engineering societies, typically ones that celebrate the contributions of a particular technical vocation to the </span><span class="c0">betterment</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of humankind, engineers appear unaware of any </span><span class="c0">philosophical</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;questions their work might entail. As a way </span><span class="c0">of starting</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;a conversation with my friends in engineering, I sometimes ask, &quot;What are the founding principles of your discipline?&quot; The question is always greeted with puzzlement. Even when I </span><span class="c0">explain</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;what I am after, namely, a coherent account </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;nature and significance of the branch </span><span class="c0">of engineering</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in which they are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">involved, the question still means nothing to them. The scant few who raise important first questions about their technical professions are usually seen by their colleagues as dangerous cranks and radicals. </span><span class="c0">If Socrates</span><span class="c1 c0">&#39; suggestion that the &quot;unexamined life is not worth living&quot; still holds, it is news to most engineers. 4</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.d2cslyc5bm12"><span class="c1 c4">Technological Somnambulism</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c0">WHY</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">IS IT</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">that the philosophy </span><span class="c0">of technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;has never really gotten under way? Why has a culture so firmly based upon countless sophisticated instruments, techniques, and systems </span><span class="c0">remained</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;so steadfast in its reluctance to examine its own </span><span class="c0">foundations</span><span class="c1 c0">? Much </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;answer can be found in the astonishing hold the idea of &quot;progress&quot; has exercised on social thought during the industrial age. In the twentieth century it is usually taken for granted that the only reliable sources for improving the human condition stem from new machines, techniques, and chemicals. Even the recurring environmental and social ills that have </span><span class="c0">accompanied</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;technological advancement have rarely dented this faith. It is still a prerequisite that the person running for public office swear his or her unflinching confidence in a positive link between technical development and human well-being and affirm that the next wave </span><span class="c0">of innovations</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;will surely be our salvation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">There is, however, another reason why the philosophy of technology has never gathered much steam. According to </span><span class="c0">conventional</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;views, the human relationship to technical things is too obvious to merit serious reflection. The deceptively </span><span class="c0">reasonable</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;notion that we have inherited from much earlier and less complicated times divides the range </span><span class="c0">of possible</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;concerns about technology into two basic categories: making and use. In the first of these our attention is drawn to the matter of &quot;how things work&quot; and of&quot;making things work.&quot; We tend to think that this is a fascination </span><span class="c0">of certain</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;people in certain occupations, but not for anyone else. &quot;How things work&quot; is the domain </span><span class="c0">of inventors</span><span class="c1 c0">, technicians, engineers, repairmen, and the like who prepare </span><span class="c0">artificial</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;aids to human activity and keep them in good working order. Those not directly involved in the various spheres of &quot;making&quot; are thought to have little interest in or need to know about the materials, principles, or procedures found in those spheres.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c0">What the others do care about, however, are tools and uses.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">This is understood to be a straightforward matter. Once things have been made, we interact with them on occasion to achieve specific purposes. One picks up a tool, uses it, and puts it down. One picks up a telephone, talks on it, and then does not use it for a time. A person gets on an airplane, flies from point A to point B, and then gets off. The proper interpretation </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">meaning</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of technology in the mode of use seems to be nothing more complicated than an occasional, limited, and non problematic interaction.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The language of the notion of &quot;use&quot; also includes standard terms that enable us to interpret technologies in a range </span><span class="c0">of moral</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;contexts. Tools can be &quot;used well or poorly&quot; and for &quot;good or bad purposes&quot;; I can use my knife to slice a loaf </span><span class="c0">of bread</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;or to stab the next person that walks by. Because technological </span><span class="c0">objects</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and processes have a promiscuous utility, they are taken to be fundamentally neutral as regards their moral standing.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c1 c0">The conventional idea of what technology is and what it means, an idea powerfully reinforced by familiar terms used in everyday language, needs to be overcome ifa critical philosophy of technology is to move ahead. The crucial weakness of the conventional idea is that it disregards the many ways in which technologies provide structure for human activity. Since, </span><span class="c0">according</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to accepted wisdom, patterns that take shape in the sphere of &quot;making&quot; are of interest to practitioners alone, and since the very essence of&quot;use&quot; is its occasional, innocuous, </span><span class="c0">nanostructuring</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;occurrence, any further questioning seems irrelevant. </span><span class="c2 c0">5</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">If the experience </span><span class="c0">of modern</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;society shows us anything, </span><span class="c0">however</span><span class="c1 c0">, it is that technologies are not merely aids to human </span><span class="c0">activity</span><span class="c1 c0">, but also powerful forces acting to reshape that activity and its meaning. The introduction of a robot to an industrial workplace not only increases productivity, but often radically changes the process of production, redefining what &quot;work&quot; means in that setting. When a sophisticated new technique or instrument is adopted in medical practice, it transforms not only what doctors do, but also the ways people think about health, sickness, and medical care. Widespread alterations of this kind in techniques of communication, transportation, </span><span class="c0">manufacturing</span><span class="c1 c0">, agriculture, and the like are largely what distinguishes our times from early periods </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;history. The kinds </span><span class="c0">of things</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;we are apt to see as &quot;mere&quot; technological entities become much more interesting and problematic if we begin to observe how broadly they are involved in conditions </span><span class="c0">of social</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and moral life.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c1 c0">It is true that recurring patterns of life&#39;s activity (whatever their origins) tend to become unconscious processes taken for granted. Thus, we do not pause to reflect upon how we speak a language as we are doing so or the motions we go through in taking a shower. There is, however, one point at which we may become aware </span><span class="c0">of a</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;pattern taking shape-the very first time we encounter it. An opportunity </span><span class="c0">of that</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;sort occurred several years ago at the conclusion </span><span class="c0">of a</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;class I was teaching. A student came to my office on the day term papers were due and told me his essay would be late. &quot;It crashed this morning,&quot; he explained. I </span><span class="c0">immediately</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;interpreted this as a &quot;crash&quot; of the </span><span class="c0">concept 4al</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;variety, a flimsy array </span><span class="c0">of arguments</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and observations that eventually </span><span class="c0">collapses</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;under the weight </span><span class="c0">of its</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;own ponderous absurdity. Indeed, some of my own papers have &quot;crashed&quot; in exactly that manner. But this was not the kind </span><span class="c0">of mishap</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that had befallen this </span><span class="c0">particular</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;fellow. He went on to explain that his paper had been com- posed on a computer terminal and that it had been stored in a time-sharing minicomputer. It sometimes happens that the </span><span class="c0">machine</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&quot;goes down&quot; or &quot;crashes,&quot; making everything that </span><span class="c0">happens</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in and around it stop until the computer can be &quot;brought up,&quot; that is, restored to full functioning.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">As I listened to the student&#39;s explanation, I realized that he was telling me about the facts </span><span class="c0">of a</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;particular form </span><span class="c0">of activity</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in modern life in which he and others similarly situated were </span><span class="c0">already</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;involved and that I had better get ready for. I remembered J.</span></p><p class="c5 c15"><span class="c1 c0">L. Austin&#39;s little essay &quot;A Plea for Excuses&quot; and noticed that the student and I were negotiating one </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;boundaries </span><span class="c0">of contemporary</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;moral life-where and how one gives and accepts an excuse in a particular technology-mediated situation. 6 He was, in effect, asking me to recognize a new world </span><span class="c0">of parts</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and pieces and to acknowledge appropriate practices and expectations that hold in that world. From then on, a knowledge </span><span class="c0">of this</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;situation would be included in my understanding </span><span class="c0">of not</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;only &quot;how things work&quot; in that generation of computers, but also how we do things as a consequence, including which rules to follow when the machines break down. Shortly thereafter I got used to </span><span class="c0">computers</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;crashing, disrupting hotel reservations, banking, and other everyday transactions; eventually, my own papers, began crashing in this new way.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c1 c0">Some of the moral negotiations that </span><span class="c0">accompany technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;change eventually become matters </span><span class="c0">of law</span><span class="c1 c0">. In recent times, for example, a number of activities that employ computers as their</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">operating medium have been legally defined as &quot;crimes.&quot; Is </span><span class="c0">unauthorized</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;access to a computerized </span><span class="c0">database</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;a criminal </span><span class="c0">offense</span><span class="c1 c0">? Given the fact that electronic information is in the </span><span class="c0">strictest</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;sense intangible, under what conditions is it &quot;property&quot; subject to theft? The law has had to stretch and reorient its </span><span class="c0">traditional</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;categories to encompass such problems, creating whole new classes </span><span class="c0">of offenses</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and offenders.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The ways in which technical devices tend to engender </span><span class="c0">distinctive</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;worlds </span><span class="c0">of their</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;own can be seen in a more familiar case. </span><span class="c0">Picture</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;two men traveling in the same direction along a street on a peaceful, sunny day, one </span><span class="c0">of them</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;afoot and the other driving an automobile. The pedestrian has a certain flexibility of </span><span class="c0">movement</span><span class="c1 c0">: he can pause to look in a shop window, speak to </span><span class="c0">passersby</span><span class="c1 c0">, and reach out to pick a flower from a sidewalk garden. The driver, although he has the potential to move much faster, is constrained by the enclosed space </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;automobile, the </span><span class="c0">physical</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;dimensions of the highway, and the rules of the road. His realm is spatially structured by his intended destination, by a </span><span class="c0">periphery</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of more</span><span class="c1 c0">-or-</span><span class="c0">Less</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;irrelevant objects (scenes for occasional side glances), and by more important objects </span><span class="c0">of various</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;kinds- moving and parked cars, bicycles, pedestrians, street signs, etc., that stand in his way. Since the first rule of good driving is to avoid hitting things, the immediate environment </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;motorist becomes a field of obstacles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Imagine a situation in which the two persons are next-door neighbors. The man in the automobile observes his friend strolling along the street and wishes to say hello. He slows down, honks his horn, rolls down the window, sticks out his head, and shouts across the street. More likely than not the </span><span class="c0">pedestrian</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;will be startled or annoyed by the sound of the horn. He looks around to see what&#39;s the matter and tries to recognize who can be yelling at him across the way. &quot;Can you come to </span><span class="c0">dinner</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Saturday night?&quot; the driver calls out over the street noise. &quot;What?&quot; the pedestrian replies, straining to understand. At that moment another car to the rear begins honking to break up the temporary traffic jam. Unable to say anything more, the driver moves on.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">What we see here is an automobile collision </span><span class="c0">of sorts</span><span class="c1 c0">, although not one that causes bodily injury. It is a </span><span class="c0">collision</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;between the world of the driver and that of the pedestrian. The attempt to extend a greeting and invitation, ordinarily a simple gesture, is complicated by the presence of a technological device and its</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">standard operating conditions. The communication between the two men is shaped by an incompatibility </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;form </span><span class="c0">of locomotion</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;known as walking and a much newer one, automobile </span><span class="c0">driving</span><span class="c1 c0">. In cities such as Los Angeles, where the physical landscape and prevailing social habits assume everyone drives a car, the simple act </span><span class="c0">of walking</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;can be cause for alarm. The U.S. Supreme Court decided one case involving a young man who enjoyed taking long walks late at night through the streets </span><span class="c0">of San</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Diego and was repeatedly arrested by police as a suspicious character. The Court decided in favor </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;pedestrian, noting that he had not been engaged in burglary or any other illegal act. Merely traveling by foot is not yet a crime. 7</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Knowing how automobiles are made, how they operate, and how they are used and knowing about traffic laws and urban transportation policies does little to help us understand how automobiles affect the texture of modern life. In such cases a strictly instrumental/functional understanding fails us badly. What is needed is an interpretation of the ways, both obvious and subtle, in which everyday life is transformed by the </span><span class="c0">mediating</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;role </span><span class="c0">of technical</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;devices. In hindsight the situation is clear to everyone. Individual habits, perceptions, concepts </span><span class="c0">of self</span><span class="c1 c0">, ideas of space and time, social relationships, and moral and political boundaries have all been powerfully restructured in the course of modern technological development. What is fascinating about this process is that societies involved in it have quickly altered some </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;fundamental terms </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;life without appearing to do so. Vast transformations in the structure </span><span class="c0">of our</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;common world have been undertaken with little attention to what those alterations mean. Judgments about technology have been made on narrow grounds, paying attention to such matters as whether a new device serves a particular need, performs more efficiently than its predecessor, makes a profit, or provides a convenient service. Only later does the broader significance of the choice become clear, typically as a series </span><span class="c0">of surprising</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&quot;side effects&quot; or &quot;secondary consequences.&quot; But it seems characteristic of our culture&#39;s involvement with technology that we are seldom </span><span class="c0">inclined</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to examine, discuss, or judge pending innovations with broad, keen awareness </span><span class="c0">of what</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;those changes mean. In the </span><span class="c0">technical</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;realm we repeatedly enter into a series </span><span class="c0">of social</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;contracts, the terms </span><span class="c0">of which</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;are revealed </span><span class="c0">oreilly</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;after the signing.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">It may seem that the view I am suggesting is that of </span><span class="c0">technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;determinism: the idea that technological innovation is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">the basic cause </span><span class="c0">of changes</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in society and that human beings have little choice other than to sit back and watch this ineluctable process unfold. But the concept of determinism is much too strong, far too sweeping in its implications to provide an </span><span class="c0">adequate</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;theory. It does little justice to the genuine choices that arise, in both principle and practice, in the course of technical and social transformation. Being saddled with it is like </span><span class="c0">attempting</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to describe all instances ofsexual intercourse based only on the concept ofrape. A more revealing notion, in my view, is that of technological somnambulism. For the interesting puzzle in our times is that we so willingly sleepwalk through the process </span><span class="c0">of reconstituting</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the conditions </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;existence.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.gwk29buooj47"><span class="c1 c4">Beyond Impacts and Side Effects</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c0">SOCIAL</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">SCIENTISTS have tried to awaken the sleeper by </span><span class="c0">developing</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;methods </span><span class="c0">of technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;assessment. The strength </span><span class="c0">of these</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;methods is that they shed light on phenomena that were </span><span class="c0">previously</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;overlooked. But an unfortunate shortcoming of </span><span class="c0">technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;assessment is that it tends to see technological change as a &quot;cause&quot; and everything that follows as an &quot;effect&quot; or &quot;</span><span class="c0">impact</span><span class="c1 c0">.&quot; The role </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;researcher is to identify, observe, and </span><span class="c0">explain</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;these effects. This approach assumes that the causes have already occurred or are bound to do so in the normal course of events. Social research boldly enters the scene to study the &quot;consequences&quot; of the change. After the bulldozer has rolled over us, we can pick ourselves up and carefully measure the treadmarks. Such is the impotent mission </span><span class="c0">of technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&quot;</span><span class="c0">impact</span><span class="c1 c0">&quot; assessment.</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c1 c0">A somewhat more farsighted version of technology </span><span class="c0">assessment</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is sometimes used to predict which changes are likely to happen, the &quot;social impacts of computerization&quot; for example. With these forecasts at its disposal, society is, presumably, better able to chart its course. But, once again, the attitude in which the predictions are offered usually suggests that the &quot;impacts&quot; are going to happen in any case. Assertions of the sort &quot;</span><span class="c0">Computerization</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;will bring about a revolution in the way we educate our children&quot; carry the strong implication that those who will experience the change are obliged simply to endure it. Humans must adapt. That is their destiny. There is no tampering with the source </span><span class="c0">of change</span><span class="c1 c0">, and only minor modifications are possible</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">at the point </span><span class="c0">of impact</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(perhaps some slight changes in the fas</span><span class="c0">h</span><span class="c1 c0">ion contour </span><span class="c0">of this</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;year&#39;s treadmarks).</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">But we have already begun to notice another view of </span><span class="c0">technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;development, one that transcends the empirical and moral shortcomings </span><span class="c0">of cause</span><span class="c1 c0">-and-effect models. It begins with the recognition that as technologies are being built and put to use, significant alterations in patterns </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;activity and </span><span class="c0">human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;institutions are already taking place. New worlds are being made. There is nothing &quot;secondary&quot; about this phenomenon. It is, in fact, the most important accomplishment </span><span class="c0">of any</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;new </span><span class="c0">technology</span><span class="c1 c0">. The construction </span><span class="c0">of a</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;technical system that involves </span><span class="c0">human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;beings as operating parts brings a reconstruction of social roles and relationships. Often this is a result </span><span class="c0">of a</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;new system&#39;s own operating requirements: it simply will not work unless </span><span class="c0">human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;behavior changes to suit its form and process. Hence, the very act </span><span class="c0">of using</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the kinds </span><span class="c0">of machines</span><span class="c1 c0">, techniques, and systems available to us generates patterns of activities and expectations that soon become &quot;second nature.&quot; We do indeed &quot;use&quot; </span><span class="c0">telephones</span><span class="c1 c0">, automobiles, electric lights, and computers in the </span><span class="c0">conventional</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;sense </span><span class="c0">of picking</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;them up and putting them down. But our world soon becomes one in which telephony, automobility, electric lighting, and computing are forms of life in the most powerful sense: life would scarcely be thinkable without them. My choice </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;term &quot;forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">&quot; in this context derives from Ludwig Wittgenstein&#39;s elaboration </span><span class="c0">of that</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;concept in </span><span class="c0">Philosophical</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Investigations. In his later writing Wittgenstein sought to overcome an extremely narrow view of the structure of </span><span class="c0">language</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;then popular among philosophers, a view that held </span><span class="c0">language</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to be primarily a matter of naming things and events. Pointing to the richness and multiplicity </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;kinds </span><span class="c0">of expression</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;or &quot;language games&quot; that are a part of everyday speech, Wittgenstein argued that &quot;the speaking </span><span class="c0">of language</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is a part of an activity, or of a form of life.&quot;</span><span class="c2 c0">8</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">He gave a variety of </span><span class="c0">examples</span><span class="c1 c0">-the giving </span><span class="c0">of orders</span><span class="c1 c0">, speculating about events, </span><span class="c0">guessing</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;riddles, making up stories, forming and testing hypotheses, and so forth-to indicate the wide range </span><span class="c0">of language</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;games </span><span class="c0">involved</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in various &quot;forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">.&quot; Whether he meant to suggest that these are patterns that occur naturally to all human beings or that they are primarily cultural conventions that can change with time and setting is a question open to dispute.</span><span class="c0 c2">9</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;For the </span><span class="c0">purposes</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;here, what matters is not the ultimate philosophical status</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">of Wittgenstein&#39;s concept but its suggestiveness in helping us to overcome another widespread and extremely narrow </span><span class="c0">conception</span><span class="c1 c0">: our normal understanding </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;meaning </span><span class="c0">of technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in human life.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c1 c0">As they become woven into the texture </span><span class="c0">of everyday</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;existence, the devices, techniques, and systems we adopt shed their tool- like qualities to become part </span><span class="c0">of our</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;very humanity. In an </span><span class="c0">important</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;sense we become the beings who work on assembly lines, who talk on telephones, who do our figuring on pocket </span><span class="c0">calculators</span><span class="c1 c0">, who eat processed foods, who clean our homes with powerful chemicals. Ofcourse, working, talking, figuring, </span><span class="c0">eating</span><span class="c1 c0">, cleaning, and such things have been parts </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;activity for a very long time. But technological innovations can radically alter these common patterns and on occasion generate entirely new ones, often with surprising results. The role television plays in our society offers some poignant examples. None of those who worked to perfect the technology </span><span class="c0">of television</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in its early years and few of those who brought television sets into their homes ever intended the device to be employed as the </span><span class="c0">universal</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;babysitter. That, however, has become one </span><span class="c0">of television&#39;s</span><span class="c1 c0">&#39; most common functions in the modern home. Similarly, </span><span class="c0">if anyone</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in the 1930s had predicted people would eventually be watching seven hours </span><span class="c0">of television</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;each day, the forecast would have been laughed away as absurd. But recent surveys indicate that we Americans do spend that much time, roughly one-third of our lives, staring at the tube. Those who wish to reassert freedom of choice in the matter sometimes observe, &quot;You can always turn </span><span class="c0">off your</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;TV.&quot; In a trivial sense that is true. At least for the time being the </span><span class="c0">on off button</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is still included as standard equipment on most sets (perhaps someday it will become </span><span class="c0">optional</span><span class="c1 c0">). But given how central television has become to the </span><span class="c0">content</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of everyday</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;life, how it has become the accustomed topic of conversation in workplaces, schools, and other social </span><span class="c0">gatherings</span><span class="c1 c0">, it is apparent that television is a phenomenon that, in the larger sense, cannot be &quot;turned off&quot; at all. Deeply insinuated into people&#39;s perceptions, thoughts, and behavior, it has become an indelible part of modern culture.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Most changes in the content of everyday life brought on by technology can be recognized as versions of earlier patterns. Parents have always had to entertain and instruct children and to find ways of keeping the little ones out of their hair. Having youngsters watch several hours </span><span class="c0">of television</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;cartoons is, in one</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">way of looking at the matter, merely a new method for handling this age-old task, although the &quot;merely&quot; is </span><span class="c0">of no</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;small </span><span class="c0">significance</span><span class="c1 c0">. It is important to ask, Where, ifat all, have modern </span><span class="c0">technologies</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;added fundamentally new activities to the range </span><span class="c0">of things</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;human beings do? Where and how have innovations in science and technology begun to alter the very conditions of life itself? Is computer programming only a powerful recombination of forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;known for ages-doing mathematics, listing, sort- ing, planning, organizing, etc.-or is it something </span><span class="c0">unprecedented</span><span class="c1 c0">? Is industrialized agribusiness simply a renovation of older ways of farming, or does it amount to an entirely new phenomenon?</span></p><p class="c5 c16"><span class="c1 c0">Certainly, there are some accomplishments of modern </span><span class="c0">technology</span><span class="c1 c0">, manned air flight, for example, that are clearly alto- gether novel. Flying in airplanes is not just another version of modes of travel previously known; it is something new. Al- though the hope of humans flying is as old as the myth of Daedalus and Icarus or the angels </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Old Testament, it took a certain kind </span><span class="c0">of modern</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;machinery to realize the dream in </span><span class="c0">practice</span><span class="c1 c0">. Even beyond the numerous breakthroughs that have pushed the boundaries of human action, however, lie certain kinds of changes now on the horizon that would amount to a </span><span class="c0">fundamental</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;change in the conditions </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;life itself. One such </span><span class="c0">prospect</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is that </span><span class="c0">of altering</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;human biology through genetic </span><span class="c0">engineering</span><span class="c1 c0">. Another is the founding </span><span class="c0">of permanent</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;settlements in outer space. Both </span><span class="c0">of these</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;possibilities call into question what it means to be human and what constitutes &quot;the human condition.&quot;</span><span class="c2 c0">10</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Speculation about such matters is now largely the work </span><span class="c0">of science</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;fiction, whose notorious perversity as a literary genre signals the troubles that lie in wait when we begin thinking about becoming creatures fundamentally different from any the earth has seen. A great many futuristic novels are blatantly technopornographic. But, on the whole, most </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;transformations that occur in the wake of technological innovation are actually variations of very old patterns. Wittgenstein&#39;s philosophically conservative maxim &quot;What has to be accepted, the given, is-so one could say-forms of life&quot; could well be the guiding rule of a </span><span class="c0">phenomenology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of technical</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;practice.</span><span class="c2 c0">11</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">For instance, asking a </span><span class="c0">question</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and awaiting an answer, a form </span><span class="c0">of interaction</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;we all know well, is much the same activity whether it is a person we are confronting or a computer. There are, </span><span class="c0">of course</span><span class="c1 c0">, significant </span><span class="c0">differences</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;between persons and computers (although it is </span><span class="c0">fashionable</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in some circles to ignore them). Forms of life that we mastered before the coming </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;computer shape our </span><span class="c0">expectations</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as we begin to use the instrument. One strategy of </span><span class="c0">software</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;design, therefore, tries to &quot;humanize&quot; the computers by having them say &quot;Hello&quot; when the user logs in or having them respond with witty remarks when a person makes an error. We carry with us highly structured anticipations about entities that appear to participate, </span><span class="c0">if only</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;minimally, in forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">associated</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;language games that are parts </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;culture. Those anticipations provide much of the persuasive power of those who prematurely claim great advances in &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; based on narrow but impressive demonstrations of computer performance. But then children have always fantasized that their dolls were alive and talking.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c1 c0">The view </span><span class="c0">of technologies</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;I am proposing has its clearest beginnings in the writings </span><span class="c0">of Karl</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Marx. In Part I of The German Ideology, Marx and Engels explain the relationship </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;individuality and material conditions </span><span class="c0">of production</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as follows: &quot;The way in which men produce their means </span><span class="c0">of subsistence</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;depends first of all on the nature of the means of </span><span class="c0">subsistence</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;they actually find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode </span><span class="c0">of production</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;must not be considered simply as being the reproduction </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;physical existence </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form </span><span class="c0">of expressing</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so they are.&quot;</span><span class="c2 c0">12</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Marx&#39;s concept of production here is a very broad and </span><span class="c0">suggestive</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;one. It reveals the total inadequacy </span><span class="c0">of any</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;interpretation that finds social change a mere &quot;side effect&quot; or &quot;impact&quot; </span><span class="c0">of technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;innovation. While he clearly points to means of </span><span class="c0">production</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that sustain life in an immediate, physical sense, Marx&#39;s view extends to a general understanding </span><span class="c0">of human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;development in a world of diverse natural resources, tools, machines, </span><span class="c0">products</span><span class="c1 c0">, and social relations. The notion is clearly not one </span><span class="c0">of occasional</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;human interaction with devices and material conditions that leave individuals unaffected. By changing the shape of </span><span class="c0">material</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;things, Marx observes, we also change ourselves. In this process human beings do not stand at the mercy </span><span class="c0">of a</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;great </span><span class="c0">deterministic</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;punch press that cranks out precisely tailored persons at a certain rate during a given historical period. Instead, the </span><span class="c0">situation</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Marx describes is one in which individuals are actively </span><span class="c0">involved</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in the daily creation and recreation, production and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">reproduction </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;world in which they live. Thus, as they </span><span class="c0">employ</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;tools and techniques, work in social labor arrangements, make and consume products, and adapt their behavior to the </span><span class="c0">material</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;conditions they encounter in their natural and artificial </span><span class="c0">environment</span><span class="c1 c0">, individuals realize possibilities </span><span class="c0">fOr</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;human existence that are inaccessible in more primitive modes of production.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Marx expands upon this idea in &quot;The Chapter on Capital&quot; in the Grundrisse. The development </span><span class="c0">of forces</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of production</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in </span><span class="c0">history</span><span class="c1 c0">, he argues, holds the promise of the development of a many-sided individuality in all human beings. Capital&#39;s </span><span class="c0">unlimited</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;pursuit </span><span class="c0">of wealth</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;leads it to develop the productive </span><span class="c0">powers</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of labor</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to a state &quot;where the possession and preservation of general wealth require a lesser labour time </span><span class="c0">of society</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as a whole, and where the labouring society relates scientifically to the </span><span class="c0">process</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of its progressive reproduction, its reproduction in </span><span class="c0">constantly</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;greater abundance.&quot; This movement toward a general form of wealth &quot;creates the material elements for the </span><span class="c0">development</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of the rich individuality which is all-sided in its </span><span class="c0">production</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as in its consumption, and whose labour also therefore </span><span class="c0">appears</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;no longer as labour, but as the full development </span><span class="c0">of activity</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;itself. &quot;</span><span class="c2 c0">13</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;If one has access to tools and materials of woodworking, a person can develop the human qualities found in the activities of carpentry. If one is able to employ the instruments and </span><span class="c0">techniques</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of music</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;making, one can become (in that aspect </span><span class="c0">of one&#39;s</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;life) a musician. Marx&#39;s ideal here, a variety of materialist </span><span class="c0">feminism</span><span class="c1 c0">, anticipates that in a properly structured society under modern conditions of production, people would engage in a very wide range </span><span class="c0">of activities</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that enrich their individuality along many dimensions. It is that promise which, he argues, the </span><span class="c0">institutions</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of capitalism thwart and cripple.</span><span class="c2 c0">14</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;As applied to an understanding of technology, the </span><span class="c0">philosophies</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of Marx</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and Wittgenstein direct our attention to the fabric </span><span class="c0">of everyday</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;existence. Wittgenstein points to a vast multiplicity </span><span class="c0">of cultural</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;practices that comprise our common world. Asking us to notice &quot;what we say when,&quot; his approach can help us </span><span class="c0">recognize</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the way language reflects the content of technical </span><span class="c0">practice</span><span class="c1 c0">. It makes sense to ask, for example, how the adoption of digital computers might alter the way people think </span><span class="c0">of their</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;own faculties and activities. </span><span class="c0">If Wittgenstein</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is correct, we would </span><span class="c0">expect</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that changes </span><span class="c0">of this</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;kind would appear, sooner or later, in the language people use to talk about themselves. Indeed, it has</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">now become commonplace to hear people say &quot;I need to access your data.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not programmed for that.&quot; &quot;We must improve our interface.&quot; &quot;The mind is the best computer we have.&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Marx, on the other hand, recommends that we see the actions and interactions </span><span class="c0">of everyday</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;life within an enormous tapestry of historical developments. On occasion, as in the chapter on &quot;</span><span class="c0">Machinery</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and Large-Scale Industry&quot; in Capital, his mode </span><span class="c0">of interpretation</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;also includes a place for a more microscopic treatment </span><span class="c0">of specific</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;technologies in human experience.</span><span class="c2 c0">15</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">But on the whole his theory seeks to explain very large patterns, especially </span><span class="c0">relationships</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;between different social classes, that unfold at each stage in the history </span><span class="c0">of material</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;production. These developments set the stage for people&#39;s ability to survive and express </span><span class="c0">themselves</span><span class="c1 c0">, for their ways </span><span class="c0">of being</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;human.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.g8x6eabrsofs"><span class="c1 c4">Return to Making</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c1 c0">T</span><span class="c0">O </span><span class="c1 c0">INVOKE</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Wittgenstein and Marx in this context, however, is not to suggest that either one or both provide a sufficient basis for a critical philosophy </span><span class="c0">of technology</span><span class="c1 c0">. Proposing an attitude in which forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;must be accepted as &quot;the given,&quot; </span><span class="c0">Wittgenstein</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;decides that philosophy &quot;leaves everything as it is.&quot;</span><span class="c2 c0">16</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Al- though some </span><span class="c0">Wittgenstein&#39;s</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;are eager to point out that this position does not necessarily commit the philosopher to </span><span class="c0">conservatism</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in an economic or political sense, it does seem that as </span><span class="c0">applied</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to the study of forms of life in the realm of technology, Wittgenstein leaves us with little more than a passive </span><span class="c0">traditionalism</span><span class="c1 c0">. </span><span class="c0">Iphone</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;hopes to interpret technological phenomena in a way that suggests positive judgments and actions, Wittgensteinian philosophy leaves much to be desired.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c1 c0">In a much different way Marx and Marxism contain the </span><span class="c0">potential</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;for an equally woeful passivity. This mode of </span><span class="c0">understanding</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;places its hope in historical tendencies that promise </span><span class="c0">human</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;emancipation at some point. As forces of production and. social relations of production develop and as the proletariat makes its way toward revolution, Marx and his orthodox </span><span class="c0">followers</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;are willing to allow capitalist technology, for example, the factory system, to develop to its farthest extent. Marx and Engels scoffed at the utopians, anarchists, and romantic critics </span><span class="c0">of industrialism</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;who thought it possible to make moral and </span><span class="c0">political judgments</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;about the course a technological society ought to take and to influence that path through the application of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">philosophical principles. Following this lead, most Marxists have believed that while capitalism is a target to be attacked, </span><span class="c0">technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;expansion is entirely good in itself, something to be </span><span class="c0">encouraged</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;without reservation. In its own way, then, Marxist theory upholds an attitude as nearly lethargic as the </span><span class="c0">Wittgensteinian</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;decision to &quot;leave everything as it is.&quot; The famous </span><span class="c0">eleventh</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;thesis on Feuerbach-&quot;The philosophers have only </span><span class="c0">interpreted</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it&quot;-conceals an important qualification: </span><span class="c0">that judgment</span><span class="c1 c0">, action, and change are ultimately products </span><span class="c0">of history</span><span class="c1 c0">. In its view of technological development Marxism anticipates a history of rapidly evolving material productivity, an inevitable course of events in which attempts to propose moral and political limits have no place. When socialism replaces capitalism, so the </span><span class="c0">promise</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;goes, the machine will finally move into high gear, </span><span class="c0">presumably</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;releasing humankind from its age-old miseries.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Whatever their shortcomings, however, the philosophies of Marx and Wittgenstein share a fruitful insight: the observation that social activity is an ongoing process of world-making. Throughout their lives people come together to renew the fabric of relationships, transactions, and meanings that sustain their common existence. Indeed, if they did not engage in this </span><span class="c0">continuing</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;activity of material and social production, the human world would literally fall apart. All social roles and </span><span class="c0">frameworks</span><span class="c1 c0">-from the most rewarding to the most oppressive- must somehow be restored and reproduced with the rise </span><span class="c0">of the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;sun each day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">From this point of view, the important question about </span><span class="c0">technology</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;becomes, As we &quot;make things work,&quot; what kind of world are we making? This suggests that we pay attention not only to the making of physical instruments and processes, al- though that certainly remains important, but also to the </span><span class="c0">production</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of psychological, social, and political conditions as a part of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a</span><span class="c1 c0">ny</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">significant technical change. Are we going to design and build circumstances that enlarge possibilities for growth in human freedom, sociability, intelligence, creativity, and self-government? Or are we headed in an altogether different direction?</span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c1 c0">It is trUe that not every technological innovation embodies choices of great significance. Some developments are more-or- less innocuous; many create only trivial modifications in how we live. But in general, where there are substantial changes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">being made in what people are doing and at a substantial </span><span class="c0">investment</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of social resources, then it always pays to ask in advance about the qualities of the artifacts, institutions, and human </span><span class="c0">experiences</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;currently on the drawing board.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">Inquiries of this kind present an important challenge to all disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Indeed, there are many historians, anthropologists, sociologists, </span><span class="c0">psychologists</span><span class="c1 c0">, and artists whose work sheds light on long-overlooked human dimensions of technology. Even engineers and other technical professionals have much to contribute here when they find courage to go beyond the narrow-gauge categories </span><span class="c0">of their</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;training.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c0">The study of politics offers its own characteristic route into this territory. As the political imagination confronts </span><span class="c0">technologies</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;as forms </span><span class="c0">of life</span><span class="c1 c0">, it should be able to say something about the choices (implicit or explicit) made in the course </span><span class="c0">of technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;innovation and the grounds for making those choices wisely. That is a task I take up in the next two chapters. Through </span><span class="c0">technological</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;creation and many other ways as well, we make a world for each other to live in. Much more than we have </span><span class="c0">acknowledged</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;in the past, we must admit our responsibility for what we are making.</span></p></body></html>
