As Florman explains it, &quot;I think that engineering is what human beings, deep down, want to do. Not the only thing, but one of the most oasic and satisfying things. Engineering is an activity that is </span><span class="c5">fulfilling</span><span class="c2">-existentially. . . . To be human is to be technological. When we are 3eing technological we are being human&quot; (pp. 19-20). But even were he human properly defined by technological abilities, Florman&#39;s argument fails to acknowledge that there are at least two fundamentally </span><span class="c5">different</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;types of technology. One implication of the analysis of part 2 is thus to raise basic questions about this kind of pro-technology argument, but in a manner that does not require straightforward </span><span class="c5">confrontation</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and opposition. We do not have to argue that human beings are not essentially technological in order to question whether they are </span><span class="c5">necessarily</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;involved with modern technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c37"><span class="c2">One final point: In light of the manifold aspects of technology revealed by the typology, the development of engineering ethics, bioethics, computer ethics, and the like may never be sufficient to &quot;control&quot; technology in its modern form. Certainly, engineering ethics as whistle-blowing seldom comes to grips with what engineers themselves take to be the essence of engineering-that is, design. But such ideas, again, point beyond this book-toward ethics-for which it must remain a prolegomenon. This work remains no more than a beginning to thinking through technology.</span></p><h1 class="c42" id="h.yefmh7m3zljn"><span class="c27">EP</span><span>I</span><span class="c16">LOGUE</span></h1><p class="c41"><span>* </span><span class="c17 c3">* * *</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.blyd0ag4k2z9"><span class="c6">Three Ways of Being-with Technology</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In serious discussions of relations between technology and humanity there readily arises a general question about the primary member in this relationship. It is difficult to deny that we exercise some choice over the kinds of technics we live with-that we control technology. But it is </span><span class="c5">equally</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;difficult to deny that technics exert profound influences on the ways we live-that they structure our existence. &ldquo;We shape our buildings,&rdquo; Winston Churchill once remarked (apropos of proposals for a new Parliament building); &quot;thereafter they shape us.&quot; But which comes first, logically if not temporally-the builder or the buildings? Which is primary-humanity or technology?</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2 c3">This is of course a chicken-and-egg question, one not subject to any straightforward, definitive answer. But it is not therefore insignificant, nor is it enough to propose as some kind of synthesis that there is simply a mutual relationship between the two, that humanity and technology are always found together, Mutual relationship is not some one thing; mutual relationships take many different forms. There are, for instance, mutualities of parent and child, of husband and wife, or of citizens. Humanity and technology can be found together in more than one way, Rather than argue the primacy of one or the other factor or the clich&eacute; of mutuality in the humanity-technology relationship, we can better pursue understanding through a structural examination of three forms the relationship itself can take, three ways of being-with technology.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">Being-with: From Persons to Technics</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To speak of three ways of being-with technology is necessarily to borrow and adapt a category from Martin Heidegger&#39;s Being and Time (1927) in a manner that deserves acknowledgment. In his seminal</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">work, Heidegger proposes to develop a new understanding of being human by taking the primordial human condition, being-in-the-world, and subjecting this given to what he terms an existential analysis. The analysis proceeds by elucidating three equiprimordial aspects of this condition of being human: the world within which the human finds itself, the being-in relationship, and the being who is in the relationship&mdash;all as a means of approaching what, for Heidegger, is the fundamental question, the meaning of Being.</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">The fundamental question need not, on this occasion, be addressed. What we can briefly consider instead is the central place of </span><span class="c5">techniques</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;in Heidegger&#39;s analysis and the disclosure of being-with as one of its central features. For Heidegger the &quot;worldhood of the world,&quot; as he calls it, comes into view through technical engagements, which reveal a network of equipment and artifacts ready-to-hand for manipulation, and other human beings likewise so engaged. These others are neither just technically ready-to-hand (like tools) nor even scientifically presentat-hand (like natural objects); on the contrary, they are like the very human being who notices them in that &quot;they are there too, and there with it&quot; (1927 trans. 1962, p. 154)).</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2 c3">The being-with relationship thus disclosed through technical engagements is therefore primarily social; it refers to the social character of the world that comes to light through technical practice. Such a World is composed not solely of tools and artifacts, but of tools used with others and artifacts belonging to others. Technical engagements are not just technical but have an immediately and intimately social dimension. Indeed, this is all so immediate that it requires a labored stepping back even to recognize and state-a distancing and articulation which are in large part precisely what philosophy is about.</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2 c3">The present attempt to step back and examine various ways of being with technology rather than being-with others (through technology) takes off from but does not proceed in the same manner as Heidegger&#39;s social analysis of the They and the problem of authenticity in the technological world. For Heidegger, being-with refers to an immediate personal presence in technics. Social being-with can manifest itself, however, not only on the level of immediate or existential presence but also in ideas. Indeed, the social world is as much a world of ideas as of persons, if not more so. Persons hold ideas and interact with others and with things through them. These ideas can even enclose the realm of technics-that is, become a language or logos of technics, a &quot;technology.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">The idea of being-with technology presupposes this &quot;logical&quot; encompassing of technics by a society and its </span><span class="c5">philoso</span><span class="c2">phical or proto</span><span class="c5">-</span><span class="c2">philosophical articulation. For many people, however, the ideas that guide their lives may not be held with conscious awareness or full articulation. They often take the form of myth. Philosophical argument and discussion introduce into such a world of ideas a break or rupture with the immediately given. This rupture need not require rejecting or abandoning that given, but it will entail bringing the given into fuller consciousness or awareness, from which it must be accepted (or rejected) in a new way or on </span><span class="c5">newgrounds</span><span class="c2 c3">.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Against this background, then, it is possible to develop </span><span class="c5">historico philosophical</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;descriptions, necessarily somewhat truncated, of three alternative ways of being-with technology. The first is what may be called ancient skepticism; the second, Renaissance and Enlightenment optimism; and the third, romantic ambiguity or uneasiness. Even in the somewhat simplified form of ideal types in which they will be presented, considering the issues that divide these three ways of </span><span class="c5">being with</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;technology may help illuminate the difficulties we face in trying to live with modern technology and its manifest problems.</span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.spolwhg2iiik"><span class="c16">Ancient Skepticism</span></h1><p class="c0 c40"><span class="c2">The original articulation of a relationship between humanity and technics, an articulation that in its earliest forms is coeval with the appearance of recorded history, can be stated boldly as &quot;technology is bad but necessary&quot; or, perhaps more carefully, as &quot;technology (that is, the study of </span><span class="c5">techniques</span><span class="c2">) is necessary but dangerous.&quot; The idea is hinted at by a plethora of archaic myths-such as the story of the Tower of Babel or the myths of Prometheus, Hephaestus, and Daedalus and </span><span class="c5">icarus</span><span class="c2 c3">, Certainly the transition from hunting and gathering to the domestication of animals and plants introduced a profound and disturbing transition into culture. Technics, according to these myths, although to some extent required by humanity and thus on occasion a cause for legitimate celebration, easily turns against the human by severing it from some larger reality--a severing that can be manifest in a failure of faith or shift of the will, a refusal to rely on or trust God or the gods, whether manifested in nature or in Providence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ethical arguments in support of this distrust or uneasiness about technical activities can be detected in the earliest strata of Western philosophy. According to the overlooked works of the Greek military lheiro and historian Xenophon, for instance, his teacher Socrates (469&mdash; 399 B.C.E.) 1 </span><span class="c5">sided</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;farming, the least technical of the arts, to be the inst shil &#39; &#39;lic, </span><span class="c5">It&#39;s</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">patients</span><span class="c2">. Although the earth &quot;provides the - Elity&#39;. I it &#39;...l. iiii ill, it ly, lattning, does not yield them tip to softness but . . . produces a kind of humanity. . . . Moreover, the Earth, being a goddess, teaches justice to those who are able to learn&rdquo; (Oeconomicus 5.4, 12). This idea of agriculture as the most virtuous of the arts, one in which human technical action tends to be kept within proper limits, is repeated by representatives of the philosophical tradition as diverse as Plato,&ldquo; Aristotle,o Thomas Aquinas,&ldquo; and Thomas jefferson.&rdquo; Elsewhere Xenophon notes Socrates&#39; distinction between questions about whether to </span><span class="c5">perform an</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;action and about how to perform it, along with one between scientific or technological questions concerning the laws of nature and ethical or political questions about what is right and Wrong, good and bad, pious and impious, </span><span class="c5">just and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;unjust.lm elaborating on the whether/how distinction, Socrates stresses that human beings must determine for themselves how to perform their </span><span class="c5">actions that</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;they can take lessons in &quot;construction [</span><span class="c5">tektonika</span><span class="c2">), forging metal, agriculture, ruling human beings, and . . . calculation, economics, and military strategy&quot; (Memorabilia 1.1.7) and therefore should not depend on the gods for help in &quot;counting, measuring, or </span><span class="c5">weighing</span><span class="c2 c3">&quot; (Memorabilia 1.1.9); the ultimate consequences of their technical actions are nonetheless hidden. His initial example is even taken from agriculture: the man who knows how to plant a field does not know whether he will reap the harvest. Thus whether we should employ our technical powers is a subject about which we must rely on guidance from the gods (cf. also Mentorabilia 4.7.10, and Anabasis 3.1).</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2 c3">At the same time, with regard to the science/ethics distinction, Socrates argues that because of the supreme importance of ethical and political issues, human beings should not allow themselves to become preoccupied with scientific and technological pursuits. In the intellectual autobiography attributed to him in the Phaedo, for instance, Socrates relates how he turned away from natural science because of the cosmological and moral confusion it tends to engender (cf. also Meinorabilia 4.76-7). In the Memorabilia it is similarly said of Socrates that &quot;he did not like others discuss the nature of all things, nor did he speculate on the &#39;cosmos&#39; of the sophists or the necessities of the heavens, but he declared that those who worried about such matters were foolish, And first he would ask whether such persons became involved with these problems because they believed that their knowledge of human things was complete or whether they thought they were obligated to neglect human things to speculate on divine things&quot; (Memorahilia 1.1.11-12).</span></p><p class="c0 c46"><span class="c2">Persons who turn away from human things to things having to do with the heavens appear to think &quot;that when they know the laws by</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">which everything comes into being, they will, when they choose, Create winds, water, seasons, and anything else like these that they may need&quot; (Memorabilia 1.1.15) (cf. Empedocles, frag. 111; see also Acadenica 1.4.15). As &quot;the first to call philosophy down from the heavens and place it in the city and ... compel it to inquire about life and morality and things good and bad&rdquo; (Cicero Tusculan Disputations 5.4.10-11),o however, Socrates&#39; own conversation is described as always about human things: What is pious? What is impious? What is good? What is shameful? What is just? What is unjust? What is moderation? For, as Xenophon says on another occasion, Socrates &quot;was not eager to make his companions orators and businessmen and inventors, but thought that they should first possess moderation (Sophrosune). For he believed that without moderation those abilities only enabled a person to become more unjust and to work more evil&quot; (Memorabilia 4.3). The whether/how distinction grants technical or how-to questions a realistic prominence in human affairs but recognizes their ambiguity and uncertainty; the science/ethics one subordinates any systematic pursuit of technical knowledge to ethical and political </span><span class="c5">concerns.</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2 c3">Such uneasiness before the immoderate possibilities inherent in technological powers is further elaborated by Plato. Near the beginning of the Republic, after Socrates outlines a primitive state and Glaucon objects that this is no more than a &quot;city of pigs.&quot; Socrates replies:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c26 c21 c9">The true state is in my opinion the one we have described-a healthy state, as it were. But if you want, we can examine a feverish state as well. . . . For there are some, it seems, who will not be satisfied with these things or this way of life; but beds, tab</span><span class="c9 c21">l</span><span class="c26 c3 c21 c9">es, and other furnishings will have to be added, and of course seasonings, perfume, incense, girls, and sweets--all kinds of each. And the requirements we mentioned before can no longer be limited to the necessities of houses, clothes, and shoes; but various technail must also be set in motion. . . . The healthy state will no longer be large enough either, but it must be swollen in size by a multitude of activities which go beyond the meeting of necessities. (372d, 373b)</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">As this passage </span><span class="c5">implies</span><span class="c2">, and as can be confirmed by earlier references to Homer and the poets, classical Greek culture was shot through with a distrist of the wealth and affluence that the technai or arts could produce is not kept within strict limits. For according to the ancients </span><span class="c5">stitch</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;will at 1:1 is people to easy things. </span><span class="c5">But Kalepa</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;ta kala, difficult</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">is the beautiful or the perfect; the perfection of anything, including human nature, is the opposite of what is soft or easy, Under conditions of affluence human beings tend to become accustomed to ease, and thus to choose the less over the more perfect, the lower over the higher, both for themselves and for others.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2 c3">With no art is this more prevalent than with medicine. Once drugs are available as palliatives, for instance, most individuals will choose them for the alleviation of pain over the more strenuous paths of physical hygiene or psychological enlightenment. The current techne of medicine, Socrates maintains to Glaucon later in Republic 3, is an education in disease that &quot;draws out death&quot; (406b); instead of promoting health, it allows the unhealthy to have &quot;a long and wretched life&quot; and &quot;to produce offspring like themselves&quot; (407d). That Socrates&#39; description applies even more strongly to modern medical technology than to that current in Athens scarcely need be mentioned.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2 c3">Another aspect of this tension between politics and technology is illustrated by Plato&#39;s observations on the dangers of technical change. In the words of Adeimantus, with whom Socrates in this instance evidently agrees, once change has established itself as normal in the arts, &quot;it overflows its bounds into human character and activity and from there issues forth to attack commercial affairs, and then proceeds against the laws and political orders&quot; (424d-e). It is desirable that obedience to the law should rest primarily on habit rather than force. Technological change, which undermines the authority of custom arid habit, thus tends to introduce violence into the state. Surely this is a possibility that the experience of the twentieth century, one of the most violent in history, should encourage us to take seriously,</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">This wariness about technological activity on moral and political grounds can be supplemented by an epistemological critique of the limitations of technological knowledge and a metaphysical analysis of the inferior status of technical objects. During a discussion of the education of the philosopher-king in Republic 7, Socrates considers what kind of teaching most effectively brings a student &quot;into the light&quot; of the highest or most important things. One conclusion is that it is not those technai that &quot;are oriented toward human opinions and desires or concerned with creation and fabrication and attending to things that grow and are put together&quot; (533b). Because it cannot convert or emancipate the mind from the cares and concerns of the world, technology should not be a primary focus of human life. The orientation of technics, because it is concerned to remedy the defects in nature, is always toward the lower or the weaker (342c-d). A doctor sees more sick</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">people than healthy ones. Eros or love, by contrast, is oriented toward the higher or the stronger; it seeks out the good and strives for transcendence. &quot;And the person who is versed in such matters is said to have spiritual wisdom, as opposed to the wisdom of one with technai or low-grade handicraft skills,&quot; Diotima tells Socrates in the </span><span class="c5">Symposium</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;(203a).</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Aristotle agrees, but for quite different, more properly metaphysical reasons. According to Aristotle and his followers, reality or being resides in particulars. It is not some abstract species Homo Sapiens (with capital H and capital S) that is in the primary sense, but Socrates and Xanthippe. However, the reality of all natural entities is dependent on an intimate union of form and matter, and the telos or end determined thereby. The problem with artifacts is that they fail to achieve this kind of unity at a very deep level and thus can have a variety of uses or extrinsic ends imposed upon them. As Aristotle observes, if a bed sprouts what grows is not a bed but a tree (Physics 193b10). Insofar as it truly imitates nature, art engenders an inimitable individuality in its products, precisely because its attempt to effect as close a union of form and matter as possible requires a respect for or deference to the materials it works with. In a systematized art or technology matter necessarily tends to be overlooked or relegated to the status of an undifferentiated substrate to be manipulated at will, Indeed, in relation to this Aristotle suggests a distinction between the arts of </span><span class="c5">cultivation for</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;example, medicine, education, and agriculture, which help nature to produce more abundantly things that she could produce of </span><span class="c5">herself from</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;those of construction or domination-arts that bring into existence things nature would not produce (compare Aristotle Physics 2.1.193a12-17; Politics 7.7.1337a2; and Oeconomica 1.1.1343a26&mdash;1343b2).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The metaphysical issue here can be illustrated by observing the contrast between a handcrafted ceramic plate and Tupperware dishes. The clay plate has a solid weight, rich texture, and explicit reference to its surroundings not unlike that of a natural stone, whereas Tupperware exhibits a lightness of body and undistinguished surface that only abstractly engages the environment of its creation and use. As an advertising argument might say, since synthetic products are &quot;better than the real thing,&quot; the word &quot;synthetic,&quot; which implies a &quot;pallid imitation,&quot; ought to be discarded. But whether this is true depends heavily in a prior understanding of what is real in the first place. For Aristotle there is a kind of reality that can be found only in particulars and is thus </span><span class="c5">beyond</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the scope of mass production, function-oriented polymer </span><span class="c2 c3">technology</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">For Plato and the Platonic tradition, too, artifice is dess real than nature. Indeed, in Republic 10 there is a discussion of the making of beds (to which Aristotle&#39;s remarks from the Physics may allude) by god or nature, by the carpenter, or tekton, and by painter or artist. Socrates&#39; argument is that the natural bed, the one made by the god, is the primary reality; the many beds made in imitation by artisans are a secondary reality; and the pictures of beds painted by artists are a tertiary reality. Tecine is thus creative in a second or &#39;third generation&#39; sense (597e)--and thus readily subject to moral and metaphysical guidance. In moral terms artifice is to be guided or judged in terms of its goodness or usefulness. In metaphysical terms the criterion of judgment is proper proportion or beauty. One possible disagreement between </span><span class="c5">Platonism</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">Aristotelianism</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;with regard to one or another aspect of making is whether the good or the beautiful, ethics or aesthetics, is the proper criterion for its guidance. Such disagreement should nevertheless not be allowed to obscure a more fundamental agreement, the recognition of the need to subject poiesis and technai to certain </span><span class="c5">well defined</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;limitations. Insofar as technical objects or activities fail to be subject to the inner guidance of nature (</span><span class="c5">physis</span><span class="c2 c3">), nature must be brought to bear upon them consciously, from the outside as it were, by human beings, Again, the tendency of contemporary technical Creations to bring about environmental problems or ecological disorders to some extent confirms the premodern point of view.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">The ancient critique of technology thus rests on a tightly </span><span class="c5">woven</span><span class="c2">, fourfold argument: (1) the will to technology or the technological intention often involves a turning away from faith or trust in nature or Providence; (2) technical affluence and the concomitant processes of change tend to undermine individual striving for excellence and societal stability; (3) technological knowledge likewise draws human beings into intercourse with the world and obscures transcendence; (4) technical objects are less real than objects of nature. Only some neces. </span><span class="c5">city</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;of survival, not some ideal of the good, can justify setting aside such arguments. The life of the great Hellenistic scientist Archimedes provides us (as it did antiquity) with a kind of icon or lived-out inhag&#39; of these arguments. Although, according to Plutarch, Archimedes was, capable of inventing all sorts of devices, he was too high-minded to do so except when pressed by military necessity-yet even then he refused to leave behind any treatise on the subject because of a salt 1 tary fear that his weapons would be too easily misused by humankin (Plutarch, &rdquo;Life of Marcellus,&rdquo; near the middle).</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2">Allied with the Judeo-Christian-Islamic criticism of the vanity of </span><span class="c5">human</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;knowledge and of worldly wealth and power,&quot; this premeltii</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">Three Ways of Being-with Technology 283</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c2">distrust of technology dominated Western culture until the end of the Middle Ages, and elements of it can be found vigorously repeated by numerous figures since-from Samuel Johnson&#39;s neoclassicist criticism of </span><span class="c5">Milton&#39;s</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;promotion of education in natural science&quot; to Norbert Wiener, who in 1947, like Archimedes twenty-three hundred years before, vowed not to publish anything more that could do damage in the hands of militarists. In one less well-known allusion to another aspect of the classical moral argument, John Wesley (1703-1791), in both private journals and public sermons, ruefully acknowledges the paradox that Christian conversion gives birth to a kind of self-discipline that easily engenders the accumulation of wealth, which then readily undermines true Christian virtue. &quot;Indeed, according to the natural tendency of riches, we cannot expect it to be otherwise,&quot; writes Wesley. 2</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2 c3">In contemporary versions of other aspects of the premodern critique, Lewis Mumford has criticized the will to power manifested in modern technology, and Heidegger, following the lead of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, has invoked the metaphysical argument by pointing out the disappearance of the thinghood of things, the loss of a sense of the earth in mass-produced consumer objects. From Heidegger&#39;s point of view, nuclear annihilation of all things would be &quot;the mere final emission of what has long since taken place, has already happened.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2 c3">From the point of view of the ancients, then, being-with technology is an uneasy being-alongside-of and working-to-keep-at-arms-length. This premodern attitude looks on technics as dangerous or guilty until proven innocent or necessary-and in any case, the burden of proof lies with those who favor technology, not those who would restraint it.</span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.9rj5mjitwmmr"><span class="c16">Enlightenment Optimism</span></h1><p class="c0 c40"><span class="c2">A radically different way of being-with technology-one that shifts the burden of proof from those who favor to those who oppose the introduction of inventions-argues the inherent goodness of technology and the consequent accidental character of all misuse. Aspects of this idea or attitude are not without premodern adumbration. But in comprehensive and persuasive form arguments to this effect are first </span><span class="c5">fully</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;articulated in the writings of Francis Bacon (1561-1626) at the time of the Renaissance and subsequently become characteristic of the </span><span class="c5">Enlightenment</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">philosophy</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;of the eighteenth century.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;L</span><span class="c2">ike Xehn, Socrates, Bacon grants that the initiation of human actions sho</span><span class="c5">uld be guided by divine council</span><span class="c2">. But unlike Socrates, Bacon</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">maintains that God has given humanity a clear mandate to pursue technology as a means for the compassionate melioration of the suffering of the human condition, of being-in-the-world. Technica</span><span class="c5">l</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;knowhow is cut loose from all doubt about the consequences of technical action. In the choice between ways of life devoted to scientific-technological or ethical-political questions, Bacon further argues that Christian revelation directs men toward the former over the latter, &quot;For it was not that pure and uncorrupted natural knowledge whereby Adam gave names to the creatures according to their propriety, which gave occaSion to the fall. It was the ambitious and proud desire of moral knowledge to judge of good and evil, to the end that man may revolt from God and give laws to himself, which was the form and manner of the temptation&ldquo; (The Great </span><span class="c5">Instauration</span><span class="c2 c3">, preface).</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2">Contrary to what is implied by the myth of Prometheus or the legend of Faust, it was not scientific and technological knowledge that led to the Fall, but vain philosophical speculation concerning moral questions. Formed in the image and likeness of God, human beings are called on to be creators; to abjure that vocation and pursue instead an unproductive discourse on ethical quandaries brings about the just punishment of a poverty-stricken existence. He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils&quot; (&quot;Of Innovations&quot;). Yet &#39;the kingdom of man, founded on the sciences,&quot; says Bacon, is &quot;not much other than . . . the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Novum </span><span class="c5">Organum</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;1.68).</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2 c3">The argument between Socrates and Bacon is not, it is important to note, simply one between anti- and pro-technology partisans. Socrates allows technics a legitimate but strictly utilitarian function, then points out the difficulty of obtaining a knowledge of consequences on which to base any certainty of trust or commitment. Technical action is circumscribed by uncertainty or risk. Bacon, however, although he makes some appeals to a consequentialist justification, ultimately grounds his commitment in something approaching deontological principles. The proof is that he never even considers evaluating technical projects on their individual merit, but simply argues for an all-out affirmation of technology in general. it is right to pursue technological action, never mind what might look like dangerous consequences. Intuitions of uncertainty are jettisoned in the name of revelation.</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">The uniqueness of the Baconian (or Renaissance) interpretation of the theological tradition is also to be noted. For </span><span class="c5">millennia</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the doctrines of God as creator of &quot;the heavens and the earth&quot; (Gen. 1:1) and (f human beings as made &quot;in the image of God&quot; (Gen. 1:27) exercised profound influence over Jewish and later Christian anthropology, </span><span class="c5">without</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;ever being explicitly interpreted as a warrant for or a call to technical activity. Traditional or </span><span class="c5">pre modern</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;interpretations focus on the soul, the intellect, or the capacity for dove as the key to the imago Dei, &quot;&ldquo;The earliest attribution to this doctrine of technological implications occurs in the early Renaissance. The contemporary theological notion of the human as using technology to prolong creation or co-create with God depends on just the reinterpretation of Genesis adumbrated by Bacon. The Enlightenment version of Bacon&#39;s religious argument is to replace the theological obligation with a natural one. In the first place, human beings simply could not survive without technics. As d&#39;Alembert puts it in the &quot;Preliminary Discourse&quot; to the Encyclopedia (1751), there is a prejudice against the mechanical arts that is a result of their accidental association with the lower classes. In truth,</span></p><p class="c0 c30"><span class="c8 c3">the advantage that the liberal arts have over the mechanical arts, because of their demands upon the intellect and because of the difficulty of excelling in them, is sufficiently counterbalanced by the quite superior usefulness which the latter for the most part have for us. It is their very usefulness which reduced them perforce to purely mechanical operations in order to make them accessible to a larger number of men. But while justly respecting great geniuses for their enlightenment, Society ought not to degrade the hands by which it is served.&#39;</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c2 c3">In the even more direct words of Immanuel Kant, &quot;Nature has willed that man should, by himself, produce everything that goes beyond the mechanical ordering of his animal existence, and that he should partake of no other happiness or perfection than that which he himself, independently of instinct, has created by his own reason.&quot; Nature and reason, if not God, command humanity to pursue technology; the human being is redefined not as Homo sapiens but as Honofaber, Technology is the essential human activity. In more ways than Kant explicitly proclaims, &quot;Enlightenment is man&#39;s release from his self-incurred tutelage&quot;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Following a redirecting (Bacon) or reinterpreting (d&#39;Alembert and Kant) of the will, Bacon and his followers explicitly reject the </span><span class="c5">ethical political</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;argument against technological activities in the name of moderation. With no apparent irony, Bacon maintains that the inventions sprinting, gunpowder, and the compass have done more to benefit humanity than all the philosophical debates and political reforms throughout history. It may, he admits, be pernicious for an individual it a nation to III&quot;. It lower. Individuals or small groups may well</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">abuse such power. &quot;But if an man endeavor to establish and extend the power and dominion of the human race itself over the universe,&#39; writes Bacon, &quot;his ambition (if ambition it can be called) is without doubt both a more wholesome and a more noble thing than the other two.&quot; And, of course, &quot;the empire of man over things depends wholly on the arts and sciences&quot; (Noturn Organium 1.129).</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Bacon does not expound at length on the wholesomeness of technics. All he does is reject the traditional idea of their corrupting influence on morals by arguing for a distinction between change in politics and in the arts. &quot;In matters of state a change even for the better is distrusted Bacon observes, because it unsettles what is established; these things resting on authority, consent, fame and opinion, not on demonstration. But arts and sciences should be like mines, where the noise of new works and further advances is heard on every side&quot; (</span><span class="c5">Novum</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Organum</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;1.90). Unlike Aristotle and Aquinas, both of whom noticed the same distinction but found it grounds for caution in technology,&#39; Bacon thinks the observation itself is enough to set technology on its own path of development.</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2">Bacon&#39;s Enlightenment followers, however, go considerably further and argue for the positive or beneficial influence of the arts on morals. In the Encyclopedia, for instance, having identified &quot;luxury&quot; as simply &quot;the use </span><span class="c5">human</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;beings make of wealth and industry to assure themselves of a pleasant existence,&quot; with its origin in &quot;that dissatisfaction with our condition ... which is and must be present in all men.&rdquo; </span><span class="c5">Saint Lambert</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;undertakes to reply directly to the ancient &quot;diatribes by the moralists who have censured it with more gloominess than light.&quot;&quot; Critics of material welfare have maintained that it undermines morals, and apologists have responded that this is the case only when it is carried to excess. Both are wrong. Wealth is, as we would say today, neutral. A survey of history reveals that luxury &quot;did not determine morals, but ... it took its character rather from them.&#39;&quot; indeed, it is quite possible to have a moral luxury, one that promotes virtuous development.</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2 c3">But if a first line of defense is to argue for moderation, and a second to urge neutrality, a third is to maintain a positive influence. David Hume (1711-1776), for instance, in his essay &quot;Of Commerces&#39; argues that a state should encourage its citizens to be manufacturers rather than farmers or soldiers. By pursuit of &quot;the arts of luxury, they add to the happiness of the state.&quot;? Then, in &quot;Of Refinement in the Arts,&quot; he explains that the ages of luxury are both &quot;the happiest and the most virtuous&quot; because of their propensity to encourage industry, knowledge, and humanity.&quot; In times when industry and the arts flourish,&rdquo; writes Hume, &quot;men are kept in perpetual occupation, and enjoy, as their reward, the occupation itself, as well as those pleasures which are the fruit of their labour&#39;</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2 c3">Furthermore, the spirit of activity in the arts will galvanize that in the sciences and vice versa; knowledge and industry increase together. In Hume&#39;s own inimitable words: &quot;We cannot reasonably expect that a piece of woolen cloth will be wrought to perfection in a nation which is ignorant of astronomy.&#39; And the more the arts and sciences advance, &quot;the more sociable men become.&quot; Technical engagements promote civil peace because they siphon off energy that might otherwise go into sectarian competition. Technological commerce and scientific aspirations tend to break down national and class barriers, thus ushering in tolerance and sociability. In the words of Hume&#39;s contemporary, Montesquieu, &quot;Commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices; for it is a general rule, that wherever we find tender manners, there commerce flourishes; and that wherever there is commerce, there we meet with tender manners&#39; (Spirit of the Laws, 1.20.1).</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">The ethical significance of technological activity is not limited to its socializing influence, however, Technology is an intellectual as well as a moral virtue, because it is a means to the acquisition of true knowledge. That technological activity contributes to scientific advance rests on a theory of knowledge that again is first clearly articulated by Bacon, who begins his Novum Organum, or &ldquo;new instrument,&rdquo; with the argument that true knowledge is acquired only by a close intercourse with things themselves: &quot;Neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can </span><span class="c5">affect</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;much. It is by instruments and helps that the work is done, which are as much wanted for the understanding as for the hard&rdquo; (Novum </span><span class="c5">Organum</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;1.2). Knowledge is to be acquired by active experimentation and ultimately evaluated according to its ability to engender works. The means to true knowledge is what Bacon candidly refers to as the &quot;torturing of nature&quot;; left free and at large, nature, like human beings, is loath to reveal its secrets.&rdquo; The result of this new way will be the union of knowledge and power (Novum Orsailini 1.3). Bacon is, quite simply, an epistemological pragmatist. What is true is what works. &quot;Our only hope,&quot; he says, &quot;therefore lies in a true induction&ldquo; (Novum </span><span class="c5">Organum</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;1.14).</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">The very basis of the great French Encyclopedia, or Rational Dictionary of Sciences, Arts, and Crafts is precisely this epistemological vision of unity between theory and practice. Bacon is explicitly identified as its inspiration ind is raised for having conceived philosophy &quot;as bein</span><span class="c5">g </span><span class="c2 c3">only that part of our knowledge which should contribute to making us better or happier, thus . . . confining it within the limits of useful things and inviting scholars to study and perfect the arts, which he regards as the most exalted and most essential part of human science&ldquo;** Indeed, in explicating the priorities of the Encyclopedia, the &quot;Preliminary Discourse&quot; goes on to say that &quot;too much has been written on the sciences; not enough has been written well on the mechanical arts.&rdquo; The article &quot;Art&quot; in the Encyclopedia further criticizes the prejudice against the mechanical arts, not only because it has &quot;tended to fill cities with ... idle speculation,&#39; but even more because of its failure to produce genuine knowledge. &quot;It is difficult if not impossible ... to have a thorough knowledge of the speculative aspects of an art without being versed in its practice,&quot; although it is equally difficult &quot;to go far in the practice of an art without speculation.&quot; It is this new unity of theory and practice-a unity based more in practice than in theory&rsquo;-that is at the basis of, for instance, Bernard de Fontenelle&#39;s eulogies on the practice of experimental science as an intellectual virtue as well as a moral one and the Enlightenment reconception of Socrates as having called philosophy down from the heavens to experiment with the world.o</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">Bacon&#39;s true induction likewise rests on a metaphysical rejection of natural teleology. The pursuit of a knowledge of final causes &quot;rather corrupts than advances the sciences,&quot; declares Bacon, &quot;except such as have to do with human action&quot; (Novum </span><span class="c5">Organum</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;2.2). Belief in final causes or purposes inherent in nature is a result of Superstition or false religion. It must be rejected in order to make possible &quot;a very diligent dissection and anatomy of the world&ldquo; (Novum </span><span class="c5">Organum</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;1.124). Nature and artifice are not ontologically distinct. &quot;All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee,&quot; claims Alexander Pope.&rdquo; The Aristotelian distinction between arts of cultivation and of construction is jettisoned in favor of universal construction.</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2">With regard to Pope, although it is not uncommon to find comparisons of the God/nature and artist/artwork relationships in Greek and Christian, ancient and modern authors, there are subtle differences. For Plato (Sophist 265b ff, and Timaeus 27c ff.) and Saint Augustine (De civitate Dei 11.21), for example, there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between divine and human poiesis, both of which must be differentiated from techne, Also, even though made by a god, the world is not to be looked upon as an artifact or something that </span><span class="c5">function</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is in an artificial manner. Thomas Hobbes, Bacon&#39;s secretary, however, proposes to view nature not just as produced by a divine art but is</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">itself &quot;the art whereby God hath made and governs the world&quot; (Leviathan, introduction). Indeed, so much is this the case that for Hobbes human art itself may be said to produce natural objects. Or, to say the same thing in different words, the whole distinction between nature and artifice disappears,</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">This last point also links up with the first; metaphysics supports volition. If nature and artifice are not ontologically distinct, then the traditional distinction between </span><span class="c5">techniques</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of cultivation and </span><span class="c5">techniques</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of domination disappears. There is no technics that helps nature to realize its own internal reality, and human beings are free to pursue power, If nature is just another form of mechanical artifice, it is likewise reasonable to think of the human being as a machine. &quot;Man is a machine and . . . in the whole universe there is but a single substance variously modified,&rdquo; concludes La Mettrie. &quot;For what is the heart,&quot; wrote Hobbes a century earlier, &quot;but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many </span><span class="c5">wheels</span><span class="c2">&#39; (Leviathan, introduction). But the activities appropriate to machines are technological ones; Homo </span><span class="c5">father</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;is yet another form of l&#39;homme-machine, and vice versa.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Like that of the ancients, then, the distinctly modern way of </span><span class="c5">being with</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;technology may be articulated in terms of four interrelated arguments: (1) the will to technology is ordained for humanity by God or by nature; (2) technological activity is morally beneficial because, while stimulating human action, it ministers to physical needs and increases sociability; (3) knowledge acquired by a technical closure with the world is more true than abstract theory; and (4) nature is no more real than artifice-indeed, it operates by the same principles. It is scarcely necessary to illustrate how aspects of this ideology remain part of intellectual discourse in Marxism, in pragmatism, and in popular attitudes regarding technological progress, technology assessment and public policy, education, and medicine.</span></p><h1 class="c34" id="h.ursp16p1pg9t"><span class="c16">Romantic Uneasiness</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The premodern argument that technology is bad but necessary characterizes a way of being-with technology that effectively limited rapid technical expansion in the West for approximately two thousand years. The Renaissance and Enlightenment argument in support of the theory that technology is inherently good discloses a way of being-with technology that has been the foundation for a Promethean unleashing of technical power 11 recedented in history. The proximate causes of this racial ti, it &#39;lit in, it in were, of course, legion: geographic, economic,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">political, military, scientific. But what brought all such factors together in England in the mid-eighteenth century to engender a new way of life, what enabled them to coalesce into a veritable new way of </span><span class="c5">being in</span><span class="c2 c3">-the-world, was a certain optimism regarding the expansion of material development that is not to be found so fully articulated at any other point in premodern culture.</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">In contrast to premodern skepticism about technology, however, the typically modern optimism has not retained its primacy in theory even though it has continued to dominate in practice. The reasons for this are complex. But faced with the real-life consequences of the Industrial Revolution, from societal and cultural disruptions to environmental pollution, post-Enlightenment theory has become more critical of technology, Romanticism, as the name for the typically modern response to the Enlightenment, thus implicitly contains a new way of </span><span class="c5">being with</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;technology, one that can be identified with neither ancient skepticism nor modern optimism.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">Romanticism is, of course, a multidimensional phenomenon. In one sense it can refer to a permanent tendency in human </span><span class="c5">nature</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;that manifests itself differently at different times. In another it refers to a particular manifestation in nineteenth-century literature and thought. Virtually all attempts to analyze this particular historical manifestation interpret romanticism as a reaction to and criticism of modern science.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">Against Newtonian mechanics, the romantics propose an organic cos</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">mology; in opposition to Scientific rationality, romantics assert the </span><span class="c5">legitimacy</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and importance of imagination and feeling. What is seldom appreciated is the extent to which romanticism can also be interpreted as a questioning-in fact, the first self-conscious questioning of modern technology. So interpreted, however, romanticism reflects an uneasiness about technology that is nevertheless fundamentally </span><span class="c5">ambivalent</span><span class="c2">; although as a whole the romantic critique may be distinct from ancient skepticism and modern optimism, in its parts it </span><span class="c5">nevertheless</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;exhibits differential affinities with both.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Consider, to begin with, the volitional aspect of technology. On the ancient view, technology was seen as a turning away from God or the gods. On the modern view, it is ordained by God or, with the </span><span class="c5">Enlightenment</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;rejection of God, by nature, With the romantics the will to technology either remains grounded in nature or is cut free from ill </span><span class="c5">extra human</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;determination. In the former instance, however, nature i&#39;. reconceived not just as mechanistic movement but as an organic striv</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">ing toward creative development and expression. From the </span><span class="c5">perspective</span><span class="c2 c3">&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">of &quot;mechanical philosophy,&quot; human technology is a prolongation mechanical order; from that of Naft philosophie it becomes a </span><span class="c5">participation</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;in the self-expression of life. When liberated from even such organic creativity, technology is grounded solely in the human will to power, but with recognition of its often negative consequences; the human condition takes on the visage of gothic pathos. The most one can argue, it seems, is that the technological intention-that is, the will to power-should not be pursued to the exclusion of other volitional options, or that it should be guided by aesthetic ideals.</span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2 c3">William Wordsworth (1770-1850), for instance, the most philosophical of the English romantic poets, in the next-to-last book of his long narrative poem The Excursion (1814), describes how he has &quot;lived to mark / A new and unforeseen creation rise&quot; (8.89-90).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">Casting reserve away, exult to see </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">An intellectual mastery exercised </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">O&#39;er the blind elements; a purpose given, </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">A </span><span class="c21">perseverance</span><span class="c8 c3">&nbsp;fed; almost a soul imparted-to brute matter.

But unlike the ancients, who called for specific limitations on technics, with the romantics there is no clear outcome other than a critical uneasiness-or a heightened aesthetic sensibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2 c3">Later, in a sonnet titled &quot;Steamboats, Viaducts, and Railways&quot; (1835), having observed contradictions between the practical and aesthetic qualities of such artifacts, Wordsworth concludes that</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">In spite of all that beauty may disown </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">In your harsh features, Nature doth embrace </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">Her lawful offspring in Man&#39;s art; and Time, </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">Pleased with your triumphs o&#39;er his brother Space, </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">Accepts from your bold hands the proffered crown </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">Of hope, and smiles on you with cheer sublime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once again technology, in Enlightenment fashion, is viewed as an extension of nature and even described in Baconian terms as the triumph of time over space. The &quot;lawful offspring&quot; is nevertheless ugly, full &quot;harsh features&quot; that beauty disowns. Yet from the &quot;bold hands&quot; of technology temporal change is given the &quot;crown of hope . . . with cheer sublime&quot; that things will work out for the good. In Wordsworth&#39;s own commentary on The Excursion, the problem &quot;is an ill-regulated and excessive application of powers so admirable in themselves.&quot;&#39; But it i</span><span class="c5">s</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">precisely this ill-regulated and excessive technology that also gives birth to a new kind of admiration, the admiration of the sublime.</span></p><p class="c0 c25"><span class="c2">With regard to the moral character of technology, ambivalence is even more apparent. Consider, for instance, the arguments of </span><span class="c5">Jean Jacques</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Rousseau (1712&ndash;1778), a man who is in important respects the father of the romantic movement, and whose critique takes shape even before the inauguration of the Industrial Revolution itself, strictly in response to ideas expressed by the philosophes. In his 1750 Discourse on the Sciences and Arts Rousseau boldly argues that &quot;as the commodities of life multiply, as the arts are perfected and luxury extended, true courage falls away, the militant virtues fade away.&#39;&quot; But what might sound at first like a simple return to the moral principles of the ancients is made in the name of quite different ideals. Virtue, for Rousseau, is not the same thing it is for Plato or Aristotle-as is clearly shown by his praise of Francis Bacon as &quot;perhaps the greatest of philosophers.&quot; In agreement with Bacon, Rousseau criticizes &quot;moral philosophy&#39; as an outgrowth of &quot;human pride&quot; as well as the hiatus between </span><span class="c5">knowledge</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and power, thought and action, that he finds to be a mark of civilization; instead, he praises those who are able to act decisively in the world, to atter it in their favor, even when these are men the Greeks would have considered barbarians. </span><span class="c5">Virtue</span><span class="c2 c3">, for instance, lies with the Scythians who conquered Persia, not with the Persians; with the Goths who conquered Rome, not the Romans; with the Franks who conquered the Gauls, the Saxons who conquered England. In civilized countries, he says, &quot;There are a thousand prizes for fine discourses, and none for good action.**o Action, even destructive action, particularly on a grand (or sublime) scale, is preferable to inaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2 c3">With Bacon, Rousseau argues the need for actions, not words, and approves the initial achievements of the Renaissance in freeing humanity from a barren medieval Scholasticism. But unlike Bacon, Rousseau sees that even scientific rationality, through the alienation of affection, can often weaken the determination and commitment needed for decisive action. Thus, in a paradox that will become a hallmark of romanticism, Rousseau turns against technology-but in the name of ideals that are at the heart of technology. He criticizes a particular historical embodiment of technology, but only to advance a project that has become momentarily or partially impotent.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">It was in England, however, where the Industrial Revolution found its </span><span class="c5">earliest</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;f</span><span class="c5">u</span><span class="c2">ll-scale manifestation, that this paradoxical critique achieve&quot; in 11 initill rind literary expression. Such expression took a</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c3">realistic turn, rejecting classical patterns in favor of the specific depiction of real situations, often in unconventional forms. Works such as William Blake&#39;s poem &quot;London&quot; (1794) and Charles Dickens&#39;s novel Hard Times (1854), in their presentation of the dehumanizing consequences of factory labor, illustrate equally well the force of this approach. Wordsworth, again, may be quoted to extend the issue of the alienation of affections to the social level. In a letter from 1801 he</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">W</span><span class="c2 c3">rites,</span></p><p class="c12 c30 c10 c38"><span class="c8">It appears to me that the most calamitous effect which has followed the measures which have lately been pursued in this country, is a rapid decay of the domestic affections among the lower orders of society.... For many years past, the tendency of society, amongst all the nations of Europe, has been to produce it; but recently, by the spreading of manufactures through every part of the country ... the bonds of domestic feeling. have gbeen weakened, and in innumerable instances entirely destroyed.... If this is true, ... no greater curse can befall a land.</span><span class="c21 c39">43</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">Romantic realism is allied with visionary symbolism, however, and through this with epistemological issues. Consider, for instance, another aspect of Blake&#39;s genius, his prophetic poems. Over a century before, John Milton had in Paradise </span><span class="c5">Lost</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(1667) already identified Satan with the technical activities of mining, smelting, forging, and molding the metals of hell into the city of Pandemonium.&quot; Following this lead, in Milton (1804) Blake identifies Satan with the abused powers of technology--and Newtonian science. Satan, &quot;Prince of the Starry Hosts and of the Wheels of Heaven,&quot; also has the job of turning &quot;the </span><span class="c5">textile</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;Mills day &amp; night&quot; (149&ndash;10), But in the prefatory lyric that opens this apocalyptic epic, Blake rejects the necessity of &quot;these dark Satanic Mills&rdquo; and cries out</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">I will not cease from Mental Fight, </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand, </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c8">Till we have built Jerusalem </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">In England&#39;s green &amp; pleasant Land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">This lyric, &quot;And Did Those Feet in Ancient Times&quot; is set to music anci becomes the anthem of British socialism. A visionary, imaginative</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">not to say utopian-socialism is the romantic answer to the romantic</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">critique of the moral limitations of technology. Mary Shelley&#39;s Frank&quot;: stein (1818), in another instance, likewise presents a love-hate </span><span class="c5">relationship</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;with technology in which what is hated is properly redeemed </span><span class="c5">not </span><span class="c2 c3">by premodern delimitation but by the affective correlate of an expansive imagination-that is, love.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Industrialization, then, undermines affection-feeling and emotion--at both the individual and social levels. And this practical fact readily becomes allied with a more theoretical criticism of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason as the sole or principal cognitive faculty, The Enlightenment argued for the primacy of reason as the only means to advance human freedom from material limitations, The romantic replies that not only does such an emphasis on reason not free humanity from material bonds (witness the evils of the Industrial Revolution), but in itself it is (in the words of William Blake) a &quot;mind-forged manacle.&#39; The focus on reason is itself a limitation that must be </span><span class="c5">overcome</span><span class="c2 c3">; and through the consequent liberation of imagination the historical condition of technical activity can in turn be altered. In the &#39;classic&quot; epistemological defense and definition of Samuel Taylor Coleridge:</span></p><p class="c12 c30 c36"><span class="c8">The imagination ... I consider either as primary, or secondary. The primary imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the </span><span class="c21">infinite</span><span class="c8 c3">&nbsp;I AM. The secondary I consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still, at all events, it struggles to idealize and to unify.&quot;t</span></p><p class="c0 c14"><span class="c2 c3">Indeed, it is this power that Blake also appeals to as the source of his social revolution when he proclaims, &quot;I know of no other Christianity and of no other Gospel than the liberty both of body &amp; mind to exercise the Divine Arts of Imagination, the real &amp; eternal World of which this Vegetable Universe is but a faint shadow, &amp; in which we shall live in our Eternal or Imaginative Bodies when these Vegetable Mortal Bodies are no more.&#39;</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2">Finally, with regard to artifacts, the romantic view is again both like and unlike that of the Enlightenment. It is similar in the belief that nature and artifice operate by the same principles, Contra the Enlightenment, however, the romantic view takes nature as the key to artifice rather than artifice as the key to nature. The machine is a diminished form of life, not life a complex machine. Furthermore, nature is no longer perceive primarily in terms of stable forms; the reality o</span><span class="c5">f nate is one of process</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and change. Wordsworth and other English romantics are taken with the &quot;mutability&quot; of nature. Lord Byron, for instance, at the conclusion of Childe </span><span class="c5">Harold&#39;s</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;Pilgrimage (1818), when he aspires &quot;to mingle with the Universe, and feel / What I can ne&#39;er express&quot; (4.177), describes nature as the</span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c21">G</span><span class="c8 c3">lorious mirror, where the Almighty&#39;s form </span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c8 c3">Glasses itself in tempests; in all time, </span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c8 c3">Calm or convulsed-in breeze, or gale, or storm</span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c8 c3">Icing the Pole, or in the torrid clime </span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c8 c3">Dark-heaving -boundless, endless, and Sublime</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">The image of Eternity.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c3">(4.83)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">Nature, thus reconceptualized, reflects its new character onto the world of artifice.</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2">For the Enlightenment, at their highest levels of reality nature and artifice both exhibit various aspects of mechanical order, the interlocking of parts in a mathematical interrelation of the well-drafted lines of a Euclidean geometry. The metaphysical character of such reality is manifest to the senses through a &quot;classical&#39; vision of the </span><span class="c5">beautiful</span><span class="c2 c3">-although there develops an Enlightenment excitement with the great or grandiose (and the consequent projecting of art beyond nature) that contradicts the models of harmonious stability within nature characteristic of classical antiquity and thus intimates romantic sensibilities. For romanticism, by contrast, the metaphysical reality of both nature and artifice is best denoted not by stable or well-ordered form but by process or change, especially as apprehended by the new aesthetic category of the sublime or the overwhelming and what Byron refers to as &quot;pleasing fear&quot; (4.184).</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">As an aesthetic category, the idea of the sublime can be traced back to Longinus (third century C.E.), who departed from classical canons of criticism by praising literature that could provoke &quot;ecstasy.&quot; But the concept received little real emphasis until Edmund Burke&#39;s Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). For Burke, beauty is associated with social order and is represented with harmony and proportion in word and figure; the sublime, by contrast, is concerned with the individual striving and is proclaimed by magnitude and broken line. &quot;Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the sutline&#39; is Burke&#39;s famous definition. Certainly modern technological objects and actions-from </span><span class="c5">Hiroshima to </span><span class="c2 c3">Chernobyl-have tended to become a primary objective correlative of Such a sentiment.</span></p><p class="c0 c35"><span class="c2 c3">Like pre modern skepticism and Enlightenment optimism, the romantic way of being-with technology can thus be characterized by a pluralism of ideas that constitutes a critical uneasiness: (1) the will to technology is a necessary self-creative act that nevertheless tends to overstep its rightful bounds; (2) technology makes possible a new material freedom but alienates from the decisive strength to exercise it and creates wealth while undermining social affection; (3) scientific knowledge and reason are criticized in the name of imagination; and (4) artifacts are characterized more by process than by structure and invested with a new ambivalence associated with the category of the sublime. The attractive and repulsive interest revealed by the sublime expresses perhaps better than any other the uniqueness of the romantic way of being with technology.</span></p><h1 class="c34" id="h.bkyx60ltmsqs"><span>Coda</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">As analysis of the romantic being-with technology has especially tended to demonstrate, the ideas associated with the four aspects of technology as volition, as activity, as knowledge, and as object cannot be completely separated. Theology, ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics are ultimately aspects of a way of being in the world. Acknowledging this limitation, it is nevertheless possible to summarize the three ways of life in relation to technology by means of the matrix in table 5.</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2">At the outset, however, the argument of this epilogue indicated a relation to Heidegger&#39;s early analysis of technology, although it has taken off in a trajectory not wholly consistent with Heidegger&#39;s own analysis or intentions. Yet there remains a final affinity worth noting. In Heidegger&#39;s existential analysis there is a paradox that the personal that is revealed through the technical is also undermined thereby. Tools are used with others and in a world of artifacts owned by others, but the others easily become treated as all the same and thus become, as he calls it, a They-mass Society. &ldquo;In utilizing public means of transport and in making use of information services such as the newspaper.&quot; Heidegger writes, &quot;every Other person is like the next. The Being with one-another dissolves one&#39;s own Dasein (or existence completely into the kind of Being of &#39;the Others, in such a way, indeed, that the Others, as distinguishable and explicit, vanish more and more&quot; (1927 </span><span class="c5">[</span><span class="c2">tran</span><span class="c5">s, 1962, p. 164]</span><span class="c2 c3">).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">With regard to the romantic way of being-with technology there is</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">also a paradox. Not only is there a certain ambivalence built into this</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">attitude, but the attitude itself has not been adopted in any wholehearted way by modern culture. Romanticism is, if you will</span><span class="c5">, uneasy</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">with itself. Indeed, this may be in part why romanticism has so far </span><span class="c2">been unable to demonstrate the kind of practical efficacy exhibited by</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">both premodern skepticism and Enlightenment optimism. The paradox of the romantic way of being-with technology is that, despite an</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">intellectual cogency and expressive power, it has yet to take hold as a </span><span class="c5">truly viable way of life. Given almost two centuries of active articula</span><span class="c2">tion, this impotence may well point toward inherent weaknesses, Could it be that romanticism has been adopted, but that it is precisely its internal ambivalences, its bipolar attempt to steer a middle course between pre modern skepticism and Enlightenment optimism, that </span><span class="c5">v</span><span class="c2 c3">itiate its power?</span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: -121.78px 121.78px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(1.57rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(1.57rad) translateZ(0px); width: 395.50px; height: 639.05px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 459.08px; height: 697.24px; margin-left: -39.87px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c15" id="h.dtl0u7tfa6w2"><span class="c6">Notes to Pages 275-78</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Teratology</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;Studies (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993).

(Correct title: &quot;On the Saying: &quot;The Love of Technology Is the Root of All Evil.&quot;)</span></p><p class="c0 c20"><span class="c2 c3">4. For Plato, see especially the Laws 5,743d, where agriculture is described as keeping production within proper limits and as helping to focus attention on the care of the soul and the body. Cf. also Laws 8,842d-e and 10.889d.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">5. For Aristotle, see especially the Politics 1.8-9 and the distinction between two ways of acquiring goods, agriculture and business, the former said to be &quot;by nature&quot; (1258a38), the latter &quot;not by nature&quot; (1258b.41). In the Politics 6.2, agrarian-based democracy is described as both &quot;oldest&quot; and &#39;best&quot; (1318b7.8). 6. Following Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas&#39;s commentary on the Politics terms farming &quot;natural,&quot; &quot;necessary,&quot; and &quot;praiseworthy&quot; (Sententia libri </span><span class="c5">politicorum</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;1, lect. 8), and again in De regimine </span><span class="c5">principum</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;2.3, Thomas identifies farming as &quot;better&quot; than commercial activities for providing for material welfare. For Thomas, however, farming tends to be spoken of in relation to all manual labor, and in consequence of the doctrine of the Fall it takes on a certain ambiguity not found in Aristotle. For instance, in the Summa theologiae 2.2, qu. 187, art. 3, &quot;Whether Religious Are Bound to Manual Labor,&quot; it is argued that all human beings must work with their hands for four reasons: to obtain food (as proof texts Thomas cites Gen. 3:19 and Ps. 128:2), to avoid idleness (Sir. 33:27), to restrain concupiscence by mortifying the body (2 Cor. 6:4-6), and to enable one to give alms (Eph. 4:28). Note that there is a subtle difference between the first two reasons (which cite the </span><span class="c5">Hebrew</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;Scriptures) and the second two (which cite the Greek Scriptures). For a relevant interpretation of Thomas&#39;s thought that nevertheless fails to recognize the tensions alluded to here, see George H. Speltz, The importance of Rural Life according to the Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1945).

Physiological learning is of such rare emergence, that one may know another half his life, without being able to estimate his skill in hydrostatics or astronomy; but his moral and prudential character immediately appears. And if I have Milton against me, I have Socrates on my side. It was his labour to turn philosophy from the study of nature to speculations upon life; but the innovators whom I oppose ... seem to think, that we are placed here to watch the growth of plants, or the motions of stars.
