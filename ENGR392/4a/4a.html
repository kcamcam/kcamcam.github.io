Because the devaluation of activities done by women has changed little, women have had strong incentive to enter male jobs, but men have had little incentive to take on female activities or jobs. The gender egalitarianism that gained traction was the notion that women should have access to upward mobility and to all areas of schooling and jobs. But persistent gender essentialism means that most people follow gender-typical paths except when upward mobility is impossible otherwise. Middle-class women entered managerial and professional jobs more than working-class women </span><span class="c2 c16">integrated</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;blue-collar jobs because the latter were able to move up while choosing a &ldquo;female&rdquo; occupation; many mothers of middle-class women were already in the highest-status female occupations. The author also notes a number of gender-egalitarian trends that have stalled.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c7 c17"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c7">Keywords</span><span class="c2 c7">: education; race; class; gender; work/occupations</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We the sometimes 1960s a &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo; call the sweeping Women&rsquo;s changes employment in the gender increased system </span><span class="c2">dramatic</span><span class="c1">- since</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">cally (Cotter, Hermsen, and England 2008); birth control became widely available (Bailey 2006); women caught up with and surpassed men in rates of college graduation (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 23); </span><span class="c2">undergraduate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;college majors desegregated substantially (England and Li 2006); more women than ever got doctorates as well as professional degrees in law, medicine, and business (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 22-23; England et al. 2007); many kinds of gender discrimination in employment and education became illegal (Burstein 1989; Hirsh 2009); women entered</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">many previously male-dominated occupations (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 10-14); and more women were elected to political office (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 25). As sweeping as these changes have been, change in the gender system has been uneven&mdash;affecting some groups more than others and some arenas of life more than others, and change has recently stalled. My goal in this article is not to argue over whether we should view the proverbial cup as half empty or half full (arguments I have always found uninteresting) but, rather, to stretch toward an understanding of why some things change so much more than others. To show the uneven nature of gender change, I will review trends on a number of indicators. While the shape of most of the trends is not in dispute among scholars, the explanations I offer for the uneven and halting nature of change have the status of hypotheses rather than well- documented conclusions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I will argue that there has been little cultural or institutional change in the devaluation of traditionally female activities and jobs, and as a result, women have had more incentive than men to move into gender-nontraditional activities and positions. This led to asymmetric change; women&rsquo;s lives have changed much more than men&rsquo;s. Yet in some subgroups and arenas, there is less clear incentive for change even among women; examples are the </span><span class="c2">relatively</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;low employment rates of less educated women and the persistence of traditionally gendered patterns in heterosexual romantic, sexual, and </span><span class="c2">marital</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;relationships.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also argue, drawing on work by Charles and Bradley, that the type of gender egalitarianism that did take hold was the type most compatible with American individualism and its cultural and institutional logics, which include rights of access to jobs and education and the desideratum of upward mobility and of expressing one&rsquo;s &ldquo;true self&rdquo; (Charles forthcoming; Charles and Bradley 2002, 2009). One form this gender egalitarianism has taken has been the reduction of discrimination in hiring. This has made much of the gender revolution that has occurred possible; women can now enter formerly &ldquo;male&rdquo; spheres. But co-occurring with this gender </span><span class="c2">egalitarianism</span><span class="c1">, and discouraging such integration is a strong (if often tacit) belief in gender essentialism&mdash;the notion that men and women are innately and </span><span class="c2">fundamentally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;different in interests and skills (Charles forthcoming; Charles and Bradley 2002, 2009; Ridgeway 2009). A result of these co-occurring logics is that women are most likely to challenge gender boundaries when there is no path of upward mobility without doing so, but otherwise gender blinders guide the paths of both men and women.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">DEVALUATION OF &ldquo;FEMALE&rdquo; ACTIVITIES AND ASYMMETRIC INCENTIVES FOR WOMEN AND MEN TO CHANGE</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the changes in the gender system heralded as &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; involve women moving into positions and activities previously limited to men, with few changes in the opposite direction. The source of this </span><span class="c2">asymmetry</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is an aspect of society&rsquo;s valuation and reward system that has not changed much&mdash;the tendency to devalue and badly reward activities and jobs traditionally done by women.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Women&rsquo;s Increased Employment</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One form the devaluation of traditionally female activities takes is the failure to treat child rearing as a public good and support those who do it with state payments. In the United States, welfare reform took away much of what little such support had been present. Without this, women doing child rearing are reliant on the employment of male partners (if present) or their own employment. Thus, women have had a strong incentive to seek paid employment, and more so as wage levels rose across the decades (Bergmann 2005). As Figure 1 shows, women&rsquo;s employment has increased dramatically. But change has not been continuous, as the trend line flattened after 1990 and turned down slightly after 2000 before turning up again. This turndown was hardly an &ldquo;opt-out revolution,&rdquo; to use the popular-press term, as the decline was tiny relative to the dramatic increase across 40 years (Kuperberg and Stone 2008; Percheski 2008). But the stall after 1990 is clear, if unexplained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Figure 1 also shows the asymmetry in change between men&rsquo;s and </span><span class="c2">women&#39;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;employment; women&rsquo;s employment has increased much more than men&rsquo;s has declined. There was nowhere near one man leaving the labor force to become a full-time homemaker for every woman who entered, nor did men pick up household work to the extent women added hours of employment (Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie 2006). Men had little </span><span class="c2">incentive</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to leave employment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Among women, incentives for employment vary. Class-</span><span class="c2">based</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;resources, such as education, affect these incentives. At first glance, we might expect less educated women to have higher employment rates than their better-educated peers because they are less likely to be married to a high-earning man. Most marriages are between two people at a similar</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 526.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 537.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">education level (Mare 1991), so the less educated woman, if she is married, typically has a husband earning less than the husband of the college </span><span class="c2">graduate</span><span class="c1">. Her family would seem to need the money from her employment more than the family headed by two college graduates. Let us call this the &ldquo;need for income&rdquo; effect. But the countervailing &ldquo;opportunity cost&rdquo; factor is that well-educated women have more economic incentive for employment because they can earn more (England, Garcia-Beaulieu, and Ross 2004). Put another way, the opportunity cost of staying at home is greater for the woman who can earn more. Indeed, the woman who did not graduate from high school may have potential earnings so low that she could not even cover child care costs with what she could earn. Thus, in typical cases, for the married college graduate, her own education encourages her </span><span class="c2">employment</span><span class="c1">, while her husband&rsquo;s high earnings discourage it. The less educated woman typically has a poor husband (if any), which encourages her employment, while her own low earning power discourages her </span><span class="c2">employment</span><span class="c1">.2 It is an empirical question whether the &ldquo;need for income&rdquo; or &ldquo;opportunity cost&rdquo; effect predominates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Recent research shows that the opportunity-cost effect predominates in the United States and other affluent nations. England, Gornick, and Shafer (2008) use data from 16 affluent countries circa 2000 and show that, in all of them, among women partnered with men (married or cohabiting), those with more education are more likely to be employed. Moreover, there is no monotonic relationship between partner&rsquo;s earnings and a woman&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">employment</span><span class="c1">; at top levels of his income, her employment is deterred. But women whose male partners are at middle income levels are more likely to be employed than women whose partners have very low or no earnings, the opposite of what the &ldquo;need for income&rdquo; principle suggests.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the United States, it has been true for decades that well-educated women are more likely to be employed, and the effect of a woman&rsquo;s own education has increased, while the deterring effect of her husband&rsquo;s income has declined (Cohen and Bianchi 1999). For example, in 1970, 59 percent of college graduate women, but only 43 percent of those with less than a high school education, were employed sometime during the year. In 2007, the figures were 80 percent for college graduates and 47 percent for less than high school (the relationship of education and employment was monotonic such that those with some college and only high school were in between college graduates and high school dropouts) (figures are author&rsquo;s calculation from data in Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2009).3</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Women Moving into &ldquo;Male&rdquo; Jobs and Fields of Study</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The devaluation of and underpayment of predominantly female </span><span class="c2">occupations</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is an important institutional reality that provides incentives for both men and women to choose &ldquo;male&rdquo; over &ldquo;female&rdquo; occupations and the fields of study that lead to them. Research has shown that predominantly female occupations pay less, on average, than jobs with a higher proportion of men. At least some of the gap is attributable to sex composition because it persists in statistical models controlling for occupations&rsquo; educational requirements, amount of skill required, unionization, and so forth. I have argued that this is a form of gender discrimination&mdash;employers see the worth of predominantly female jobs through biased lenses and, as a </span><span class="c2">resultset</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pay levels for both men and women in predominantly female jobs lower than they would be if the jobs had a more heavily male sex composition (England 1992; Kilbourne et al. 1994; England and Folbre 2005). While the overall sex gap in pay has diminished because more women have moved into &ldquo;male&rdquo; fields (England and Folbre 2005), there is no evidence that the devaluation of occupations because they are filled with women has</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">diminished (Levanon, England, and Allison 2009). Indeed, as U.S. courts have interpreted the law, this type of between-job discrimination is not even illegal (England 1992, 225-51; Steinberg 2001), whereas it is illegal to pay women less than men in the same job, unless based on factors such as seniority, qualifications, or performance. Given this, both men and women continue to have a pecuniary incentive to choose male-dominated occupations. Thus, we should not be surprised that desegregation of </span><span class="c2">occupations</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;has largely taken the form of women moving into male-dominated fields, rather than men moving into female-dominated fields.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Consistent with the incentives embedded in the ongoing devaluation of female fields, desegregation of fields of college study came from more women going into fields that were predominantly male, not from more men entering &ldquo;female&rdquo; fields. Since 1970, women increasingly majored in previously male-dominated, business-related fields, such as business, marketing, and accounting; while fewer chose traditionally female majors like English, education, and sociology; and there was little increase of men&rsquo;s choice of these latter majors (England and Li 2006, 667-69). Figure 2 shows the desegregation of fields of bachelor&rsquo;s degree receipt, using the index of dissimilarity (D), a scale on which complete segregation (all fields are all male or all female) is 100 and complete integration (all fields have the same proportion of women as women&rsquo;s proportion of all bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in the given year) is 0. It shows that segregation dropped </span><span class="c2">significantly</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the 1970s and early 1980s, but has been quite flat since the mid- 1980s. Women&rsquo;s increased integration of business fields stopped then as well (England and Li 2006).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Women have also recently increased their representation in formerly male-dominated professional degrees, getting MDs, MBAs, and law degrees in large numbers. Women were 6 percent of those getting MDs in 1960, 23 percent in 1980, 43 percent in 2000, and 49 percent in 2007; the analogous numbers for law degrees (JDs) were 3, 30, 46, and 47 percent, and for MBAs (and other management first-professional degrees), 4, 22, 39, and 44 percent (National Center for Education Statistics 2004-2008). There was no marked increase in the proportion of men in female-dominated </span><span class="c2">graduate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;professional programs such as library science, social work, or </span><span class="c2">nursing</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(National Center for Education Statistics 2009).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As women have increasingly trained for previously male-dominated fields, they have also integrated previously male-dominated occupations in management and the professions in large numbers (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 10-13). Women may face discrimination and coworker resistance when they attempt to integrate these fields, but they have a</span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 456.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 456.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">strong pecuniary incentive to do so. Men lose money and suffer cultural disapproval when they choose traditionally female-dominated fields; they have little incentive to transgress gender boundaries. While some men have entered female-intensive retail service jobs after losing manufacturing jobs, there is little incentive for voluntary movement in this direction, making desegregation a largely one-way street.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about employers&rsquo; incentives? There is some debate about whether, absent equal employment legislation, employers have an incentive to engage in hiring and placement discrimination or are better off simply hiring gender- blind (for debate, see Jackson 1998; England 1992, 54-68). Whichever is true, legal enforcement of </span><span class="c2">anti discrimination</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;laws has imposed some costs for hiring discrimination (Hirsh 2009), and this has probably reduced </span><span class="c2">discrimination</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in hiring, contributing to desegregation of jobs.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">The &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; Realm</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The personal is political&rdquo; was a rallying cry of 1960s feminists, urging women to demand equality in private as well as public life. Yet conventions embodying male dominance have changed much less in &ldquo;the personal&rdquo; than in the job world. Where they have changed, the asymmetry described above for the job world prevails. For example, parents are more likely to</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">give girls &ldquo;boy&rdquo; toys such as Legos than they are to give dolls to their sons. Girls have increased their participation in sports more than boys have taken up cheerleading or ballet. Women now commonly wear pants, while men wearing skirts remains rare. A few women started keeping their birth-given surname upon marriage (Goldin and Shim 2004), with little adoption by men of women&rsquo;s last names. Here, as with jobs, the asymmetry follows incentives, albeit nonmaterial ones. These social incentives themselves flow from a largely unchanged devaluation of things culturally defined as feminine. When boys and men take on &ldquo;female&rdquo; activities, they often suffer disrespect, but under some circumstances, girls and women gain respect for taking on &ldquo;male&rdquo; activities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is more striking than the asymmetry of gender change in the </span><span class="c2">personal</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;realm is how little gendering has changed at all in this realm, </span><span class="c2">especially</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in dyadic heterosexual relationships. It is still men who usually ask women on dates, and sexual behavior is generally initiated by men (England, Shafer, and Fogarty 2008). Sexual permissiveness has increased, making it more acceptable for both heterosexual men and women to have sex </span><span class="c2">outside</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;committed relationships. But the gendered part of this&mdash;the double standard&mdash;persists stubbornly; women are judged much more harshly than men for casual sex (Hamilton and Armstrong 2009; England, Shafer, and Fogarty 2008). The ubiquity of asking about height in Internet dating Web sites suggests that the convention that men should be taller than their female partner has not budged. The double standard of aging prevails, making women&rsquo;s chances of marriage decrease with age much more than men&rsquo;s (England and McClintock 2009). Men are still expected to propose marriage (Sassler and Miller 2007). Upon marriage, the vast majority of women take their husband&rsquo;s surname. The number of women keeping their own name increased in the 1970s and 1980s but little thereafter, never exceeding about 25 percent even for college graduates (who have higher rates than other women) (Goldin and Shim 2004). Children are usually given their father&rsquo;s surname; a recent survey found that even in cases where the mother is not married to the father, 92 percent of babies are given the father&rsquo;s last name (</span><span class="c2">MccLanahan</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;forthcoming). While we do not have trend data on all these personal matters, my sense is that they have changed much less than gendered features of the world of paid work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The limited change seen in the heterosexual personal realm may be because women&rsquo;s incentive to change these things is less clear than their incentive to move into paid work and into higher-paying &ldquo;male&rdquo; jobs. The incentives that do exist are largely </span><span class="c2">non economic</span><span class="c1">. For example, women may find it meaningful to keep their birth-given surnames and give them</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">to their children, and they probably enjoy sexual freedom and initiation, especially if they are not judged adversely for it. But these </span><span class="c2">non economic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;benefits may be neutralized by the noneconomic penalties from </span><span class="c2">transgressing</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;gender norms and by the fact that some have internalized the norms. When women transgress gender barriers to enter &ldquo;male&rdquo; jobs, they too may be socially penalized for violating norms, but for many this is offset by the economic gain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">CO-OCCURRING LOGICS OF WOMEN&rsquo;S RIGHTS TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND GENDER ESSENTIALISM</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have stressed that important change in the gender system has taken the form of women integrating traditionally male occupations and fields of study. But even here change is uneven. The main generalization is shown by Figure 3, which divides all occupations by a crude measure of class, calling professional, management, and </span><span class="c2">non retail</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;sales occupations &ldquo;middle class,&rdquo; and all others &ldquo;working class&rdquo; (including retail sales, assembly work in manufacturing, blue-collar trades, and other </span><span class="c2">non professional</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">service</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;work). Using the index of dissimilarity to measure segregation, Figure 3 shows that desegregation has proceeded much farther in middle-class than working-class jobs. Middle-class jobs showed dramatic desegregation, although the trend lessened its pace after 1990. By contrast, working-class jobs are almost as segregated as they were in 1950! Women have integrated the previously male strongholds of management, law, medicine, and </span><span class="c2">academia</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in large numbers. But women have hardly gained a foothold in blue- collar, male-dominated jobs such as plumbing, construction, truck driving, welding, and assembly in durable manufacturing industries such as auto and steel (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 12-14). This is roughly the situation in other affluent nations as well (Charles and Grusky 2004). This same class difference in trend can be seen if we compare the degree of segregation among those who have various levels of education; in the United States, sex segregation declined much more dramatically since 1970 for college graduates than any other group (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2009, 2004, 13-14).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why has desegregation been limited to high-level jobs? The question has two parts: why women did not integrate blue-collar male jobs in </span><span class="c2">significant</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;numbers, and why women did integrate professional and </span><span class="c2">managerial</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;jobs in droves. Why one and not the other? Many factors were undoubtedly at work,4 but I will focus on one account, which borrows from</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 617.00px; height: 536.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 536.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Charles and Bradley (Charles forthcoming; Charles and Bradley 2002, 2009). In the United States and many Western societies today, a certain kind of gender egalitarianism has taken hold ideologically and institution- ally. The logic is that individuals should have equal rights to education and jobs of their choice. Moreover, achievement and upward mobility are </span><span class="c2">generally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;valued. There is also a &ldquo;postmaterialist&rdquo; aspect to the culture which orients one to find her or his &ldquo;true self.&rdquo; The common ethos is a </span><span class="c2">combination</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of &ldquo;the American dream&rdquo; and liberal individualism. Many women, like men, want to &ldquo;move up&rdquo; in earnings and/or status, or at least avoid moving down. But up or down relative to what reference group? I suggest that the implicit reference group is typically those in the previous generation (or previous birth cohorts) of one&rsquo;s own social class background and one&rsquo;s own sex. For example, women might see their mothers or aunts as a </span><span class="c2">reference</span><span class="c1">, or women who graduated with their level of education ten years ago. Persons of the same-sex category are the implicit reference group because of strong beliefs in gender essentialism, that notion that men and women are innately and fundamentally different (Charles forthcoming; Ridgeway</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">2009). While liberal individualism encourages a commitment to &ldquo;free choice&rdquo; gender egalitarianism (such as legal equality of opportunity), </span><span class="c2">ironically</span><span class="c1">, orienting toward gender-typical paths has probably been encouraged by the emerging form of individualism that stresses finding and expressing one&rsquo;s &ldquo;true self.&rdquo; Notions of self will in fact be largely socially constructed, pulling from socially salient identities. Because of the omnipresent nature of gender in the culture (Ridgeway 2009; West and Zimmerman 1987), gender often becomes the most available material from which to construct aspirations and may be used even more when a job choice is seen as a deep statement about self (Charles and Bradley 2009).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given all this, I hypothesize that if women can move &ldquo;up&rdquo; in status or income relative to their reference group while still staying in a job typically filled by women, then because of gender beliefs and gendered identities, they are likely to do so. If they cannot move up without integrating a male field, and demand is present and discrimination not too strong, they are more likely to cross the gender boundary. Applying this hypothesis, why would women not enter male blue-collar fields? To be sure, many women without college degrees would earn much more in the skilled blue-collar crafts or unionized manufacturing jobs than in the service jobs typically filled by women at their education levels&mdash;jobs such as maid, child care worker, retail sales clerk, or assembler in the textile industry. So they have an </span><span class="c2">economic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;incentive to enter these jobs. But such women could also move &ldquo;up&rdquo; to clerical work or teaching, higher status and better paying but still </span><span class="c2">traditionally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;female jobs. Many take this path, often getting more education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In contrast, consider women who assumed they would go to college and whose mothers were in female-dominated jobs requiring a college degree like teacher, nurse, librarian, or social worker. For these women, to move up in status or earnings from their reference group options requires them to enter traditionally male jobs; there are virtually no heavily female jobs with higher status than these female professions. These are just the women, usually of middle-class origins, who have been integrating management, law, medicine, and academia in recent decades. For them, upward mobility was not possible within traditional boundaries, so they were more likely to integrate male fields.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In sum, my argument is that one reason that women integrated male </span><span class="c2">professions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and management much more than blue-collar jobs is that the women for whom the blue-collar male jobs would have constituted &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">progress</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; also had the option to move up by entering higher-ranking female jobs via more education. They thus had options for upward mobility without transgressing gender boundaries not present for their middle-class sisters.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 521.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 521.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even women entering male-typical occupations, however, sometimes choose the more female-intensive subfields in them. In some cases, ending up in female-intensive subfields results from discrimination, but in others it may result from the gender essentialism discussed above. An example is the movement of women into doctoral study and into the occupation of &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">professor</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo; This development brought women into a new arena. But within this arena, there was virtually no desegregation of fields of doctoral study from 1970 on (England et al. 2007, 32).5 Women have gone from being only 14 percent of those who get doctorates in 1971 to nearly half. But, </span><span class="c2">conditional</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on getting a doctoral degree, neither women nor men have changed the fields of study they choose much (England et al. 2007). This can be seen in Figure 4, which shows the percentage of women in nine large fields of study in each year from 1971 to 2006. The percentage female in every field went up dramatically, reflecting the overall increase in women getting </span><span class="c2">doctorates</span><span class="c1">. But the rank order of fields in their percentage female changed little. The fields with the highest percentage of women today are those that already had a high percentage of women decades ago relative to other fields.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What explains the failure of fields of doctoral study&mdash;and thus </span><span class="c2">academic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;departments&mdash;to desegregate? Following the line of argument above,</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I suggest that the extreme differentiation of fields of academic study allowed many women moving &ldquo;up&rdquo; to doctoral study and an academic career to do so in fields that seemed consistent with their (tacitly gendered) notions of their interests and &ldquo;true selves.&rdquo; Women academics in the humanities and social sciences thus find themselves in the more female subunits (disciplines) of a still largely male-dominated larger unit (the </span><span class="c2">professoriate</span><span class="c1">).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">CONCLUSION</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Change in the gender system has been uneven, changing the lives of some groups of people more than others and changing lives in some arenas more than others. Although many factors are at play, I have offered two broad explanations for the uneven nature of change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, I argued that, because of the cultural and institutional devaluation of characteristics and activities associated with women, men had little </span><span class="c2">incentive</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to move into badly rewarded, traditionally female activities such as homemaking or female-dominated occupations. By contrast, women had powerful economic incentives to move into the traditionally male domains of paid employment and male-typical occupations; and when hiring </span><span class="c2">discrimination</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;declined, many did. These incentives varied by class, however; the incentive to go to work for pay is much stronger for women who can earn more; thus employment levels have been higher for well-educated women. I also noted a lack of change in the gendering of the personal realm, especially of heterosexual romantic and sexual relationships</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Second, I explored the consequences of the co-occurrence of two West- ern cultural and institutional logics. Individualism, encompassing a belief in rights to equal opportunity in access to jobs and education in order to express one&rsquo;s &ldquo;true self,&rdquo; promotes a certain kind of gender </span><span class="c2">egalitarianism</span><span class="c1">. It does not challenge the devaluation of traditionally female spheres, but it encourages the rights of women to upward mobility through equal access to education and jobs. To be sure, this ideal has been imperfectly realized, but this type of gender egalitarianism has taken hold strongly. But co-occurring with it, somewhat paradoxically, are strong (if tacit) beliefs in gender essentialism&mdash;that men and women are innately and </span><span class="c2">fundamentally</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;different in interests and skills (Charles forthcoming; Charles and Bradley 2002, 2009; Ridgeway 2009). Almost no men and precious few women, even those who believe in &ldquo;equal opportunity,&rdquo; have an explicit commitment to undoing gender differentiation for its own sake. Gender essentialism encourages traditional choices and leads women to</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">see previous cohorts of women of their social class as the reference point from which they seek upward mobility. I concluded that the co-occurrence of these two logics&mdash;equal opportunity individualism and gender essentialism&mdash; make it most likely for women to move into nontraditional fields of study or work when there is no possible female field that constitutes upward mobility from the socially constructed reference point. This helps explain why women integrated male-dominated professional and managerial jobs more than blue-collar jobs. Women from working-class backgrounds, whose mothers were maids or assemblers in nondurable manufacturing, could move up financially by entering blue-collar &ldquo;male&rdquo; trades but often decide instead to get more education and move up into a female job such as secretary or teacher. It is women with middle-class backgrounds, whose mothers were teachers or nurses, who cannot move up without entering a male-dominated career, and it is just such women who have integrated management, law, medicine, and academia. Yet even while integrating large fields such as academia, women often gravitate toward the more female- typical fields of study.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As sociologists, we emphasize links between parts of a social system. For example, we trace how gender inequality in jobs affects gender </span><span class="c2">inequality</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the family, and vice versa (England and Farkas 1986). Moreover, links between parts of the system are recognized in today&rsquo;s prevailing view in which gender is itself a multilevel system, with causal arrows going both ways from macro to micro (Risman 2004). All these links undoubtedly exist, but the unevenness of gender-related change highlights how loosely coupled parts of the social system are and how much stronger some causal forces for change are than others. For example, because it resonated with liberal individualism well, the part of the feminist message that urged giving women equal access to jobs and education made considerable headway and led to much of what we call the gender revolution. But even as women </span><span class="c2">integrated</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;employment and &ldquo;male&rdquo; professional and managerial jobs, the part of feminism challenging the devaluation of traditionally female activities and jobs made little headway. The result is persistently low rewards for women who remain focused on mothering or in traditionally female jobs and little incentive for men to make the gender revolution a two-way street. While discussing the uneven character of gender change, I also noted that the type of gender change with the most momentum&mdash;middle-class women entering traditionally male spheres&mdash;has recently stalled (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2004, 2009). Women&rsquo;s employment rates </span><span class="c2">stabilized</span><span class="c1">, desegregation of occupations slowed down, and desegregation of fields of college study stopped. Erosion of the sex gap in pay slowed as</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">well (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2009). While the reason for the stalling is unclear, like the unevenness of change, the stalling of change reminds us how contingent and path-dependent gender egalitarian change is, with no inexorable equal endpoint. Change has been as much unintended consequence of larger institutional and cultural forces as realization of the efforts of feminist organizing, although the latter has surely helped.6 Indeed, given the recent stalling of change, future feminist organizing may be necessary to revitalize change.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">NOTES</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">1. In this article, I use the term class to cover both </span><span class="c2">categorical</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;notions of class and gradational notions of socioeconomic position. Often I use education or occupation as imperfect but readily available indicators of class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. A complementary hypothesis about why employment rates are lower for less educated women is that, compared to women with more education, they place a higher value on motherhood and find less intrinsic meaning in the jobs they can get. In this vein, Edin and Kefalas (2005) argue that low-income women place a higher value on motherhood because they have so few alternative sources of </span><span class="c2">meaning</span><span class="c1">. However, Ferree (1976) found that working-class women were happier if employed; they worked for the money but also gained a sense of competence, </span><span class="c2">connectedness</span><span class="c1">, and self-determination from their jobs. McQuillan et al. (2008) find that neither education nor careerism is associated with the value placed on </span><span class="c2">motherhood</span><span class="c1">. Overall, there is no clear conclusion on class differences in how women value motherhood and jobs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. Women&rsquo;s employment is higher at higher education levels, but it is not clear if the gender gap in employment is less at higher education levels. This is because men&rsquo;s employment is also affected by education. For example, in 2007, 94 percent of men with a college education, but only 74 percent of those with less than high school, were employed sometime during the year (Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2009). How gender inequality in employment varies by education depends on the metric used to measure inequality. Inequality is smaller at high education levels if the ratio of women&rsquo;s to men&rsquo;s proportion employed is used, but not if the </span><span class="c2">difference</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;between men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s log odds of employment is used (author </span><span class="c2">calculations</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2009; results not shown).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4. One important additional factor is that blue-collar male jobs have been </span><span class="c2">contracting</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Morris and Western 1999), so integrating them would have been more difficult even if women had wanted to do so. Moreover, male coworkers may fight harder to harass and keep women out of blue-collar than professional and </span><span class="c2">managerial</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;jobs; lacking class privilege, blue-collar men may feel a stronger need than more privileged men to defend their gender privilege. Finally, it is possible that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had an institutional bias toward</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">bringing cases challenging discrimination in high-level managerial and professional positions, particularly when they became concerned with the &ldquo;glass ceiling.&rdquo; This could explain why Burstein (1989) found more discrimination cases in high-level jobs. 5. England et al. (2007) showed no nontrivial change in segregation of doctoral degrees through 2002. Using the same source (National Center for Education Statistics 2004-2007), I have computed the index of dissimilarity, which shows that the lack of change continued through 2006 (results not shown).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">6. Risman (2009) reminds us that our own teaching has probably had an effect on keeping feminism alive, as today&rsquo;s young feminists often say that the college classroom is where they began to identify as feminists.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">REFERENCES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Bailey, Martha J. 2006.
